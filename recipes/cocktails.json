Then add two straws and enjoy. Mexican muleTequila really loves ginger and lime and all three come together beautifully in this Mexican twist on the mule. Just make the drink as normal but instead of rum, use a nice lightly-aged reposado tequila like Ocho or Olmeca Altos – it will give the drink a whole new layer of interest."

Just make the drink as normal, substituting cognac for gin, then garnish with a slice of ginger or a ribbon of lemon peel. Elderflower CollinsElderflower and lemon is a winning combination. You can make it with elderflower cordial or liqueur for something a touch more boozy. Mix the drink as normal, but use the liqueur or cordial in place of the sugar syrup. Garnish with a lemon slice."

   "Shake all the ingredients in a cocktail shaker and strain into a cocktail glass. Strawberry daiquiriThis cocktail should only be attempted with fruit that’s really ripe and sweet – if the berries are the big, bland variety from the chiller cabinet, the end result will just taste of mush. Allow one large handful of hulled strawberries for each cocktail. Place them in the empty shaker and give them a gentle crush with a muddler or pestle, then add the other ingredients and shake as normal and strain into your cocktail glass. Out of season, you could also make a version of this drink using Funkin strawberry purée which will be almost as good. Hemingway’s ‘Papa Doble’ daiquiriThe writer Ernest Hemingway drank at El Floridita in Havana so often they ended up creating a daiquiri recipe especially for him called the Papa Doble, made with a quadruple measure of white rum, lime, grapefruit juice and maraschino liqueur. I don’t think many of us could handle a drink this size – as delicious as it is – so I’ve scaled it back a bit: 50ml white rum, 15ml pink grapefruit juice, 15ml lime juice, 15ml Luxardo maraschino liqueur, 5ml sugar syrup, shaken and strained into a cocktail glass or blended with ice, depending on what you prefer. La Terraza’s blue daiquiriAnother place Hemingway liked to drink when he went fishing was a little waterside bar about 10 miles outside Havana called La Terraza. La Terraza’s signature daiquiri is made with blue curaçao, so it’s the colour of a lagoon. You can make one too, simply by substituting 15ml Bols Blue curaçao in a normal daiquiri in place of the sugar syrup. A delicious guilty pleasure on a summer’s day, especially with a cocktail umbrella."

Add 50ml gin, 25ml lemon juice, 25ml sugar syrup and fill the glass two thirds full with crushed ice. Mix with a long-handled spoon. Top with more crushed ice, a garnish and paper straws.Bramble royaleGo glam with your bramble by adding a splash of champagne to the mix. Just make the drink as normal but reduce the amount of crushed ice by about a third to leave room for the fizz. Then top with 25-50ml of champagne, mix gently, add a bit more crushed ice, garnish and serve.Peach sourThe classic ‘sour’ formula that the bramble sticks to is easy to adapt by switching out the liqueur. Try 12.5ml of crème de peche instead of crème de mure – it might not look quite as eye-catching as the bloodshot bramble but it will taste just as delicious."

   "Ensure the jar is sealed and store in a cool dark place, turning/shaking once a day for the first week. After 2-3 weeks you can strain the vodka through a sieve lined with coffee filter papers or a clean kitchen cloth. Pour the vodka back into mini bottles and label. The vodka will keep its pink colour for a few months, but will be drinkable for 2 years."
