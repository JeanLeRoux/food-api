   "Arrange the cake pieces in the bottom of a large trifle dish, then drizzle over 20ml of the liqueur or madeira wine and set aside.",
   "For the coffee crémeux, tip the custard and coffee granules into a large pan set over a medium heat and bring to the boil, stirring continuously. Put the chocolate in a large heatproof bowl and, when the custard is boiling, pour it over, whisking until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth. Leave to cool for 5 mins until just warm, then whisk in the butter until well combined. Pour the crémeux over the cake layer in the dish and level with the back of a spoon. Chill for 1 hr until set.",
   "Mix the remaining coffee liqueur or madeira with the cooled coffee in a shallow bowl. Dip the sponge fingers in the mixture for 5 seconds on each side, arranging them in a single layer over the set crémeux, then vertically against the side of the trifle dish. Keep chilled while you prepare the tiramisu filling.",
   "Tip the egg yolks, caster sugar and marsala wine into a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, ensuring the bowl doesn’t touch the water, and beat with an electric whisk for 10 mins until pale and light. Put in the fridge to cool.",
   "Meanwhile, in a separate bowl, beat the mascarpone and double cream together to soft peaks using an electric whisk. Gently whisk in the cooled egg yolk mixture until the filling is smooth and lump-free. Spoon the tiramisu filling over the sponge fingers in the trifle dish and chill for at least 30 mins.",
   "Meanwhile, for the brown sugar cream, tip the double cream and brown sugar into a large bowl and beat with an electric whisk until the mixture holds soft peaks and can easily ripple off the spoon. Spoon dollops of the brown sugar cream over the tiramisu filling, then sift over the cocoa powder before serving. Will keep covered in the fridge for up to three days."

   "Line a 25 x 20cm traybake tin with baking parchment and heat the oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Tip the sugar, bananas, oil and eggs into a large bowl and whisk them together. If your bananas are very ripe then you can use a balloon whisk for this, or use a fork to mash. Add the flours, cinnamon and baking powder and whisk the mixture until everything is just combined – don’t take too long over this bit as the baking powder will have started to activate. Stir in the chocolate chips, if using, and scoop the mixture into your tin. Bake for 30-40 mins or until the sponge is firm and springy to the touch and lightly browned on top. Cool in the tin.",
   "To make the frosting, beat the butter until it is really soft then beat in the icing sugar. Use a spatula to fold in the soft cheese, making sure it is all thoroughly mixed in. Don’t be tempted to beat the mixture, this will make it runnier.",
   "Lift the cake carefully out of the tin, peel off the paper and transfer it to a plate or board. Spread over the frosting, making it as neat or messy as you like. Lightly dust the top with cinnamon – use a tea strainer to help with this if you have one. Cut into pieces to serve. Will keep for up to 3 days in an airtight container."

Pour the cream into a bowl and whisk until it’s just holding its shape – be careful not to overwhisk, as it will continue to thicken as you pipe it. Transfer the cream to a piping bag fitted with a fine star nozzle.",

Pipe half the whipped cream over in a zig-zag pattern and top with the chopped strawberries and any syrupy juice from the bowl. Sandwich with the top of the cake. Pipe the remaining whipped cream over in the same way, then arrange the halved, quartered and whole strawberries on top. Drizzle over the icing to finish. Best served the same day, but will keep covered in the fridge for up to three days. "

  "Ingredients": [

    "900ml double cream",
    "150g caster sugar",
    "1½ tsp vanilla extract",
    "6 gelatine leaves",
    "400g natural Greek-style yogurt",
    "12 ripe peaches or nectarines",

    "2 oranges, juiced",
    "2 tsp orange blossom water (optional)",

    "500g shop-bought fresh custard",

    "handful of pistachios, roughly chopped",
    "honeycomb, to garnish (optional)"
   ]

   "Ingredients"
  ],
  "Method": [
   "Start the trifle the day before you want to serve it. Pour 600ml of the cream into a saucepan along with 75g of the caster sugar and the vanilla. Warm gently over a low heat until steaming, then remove from the heat. Meanwhile, soak three of the gelatine leaves in a bowl of cold water for 5 mins until softened. Make sure to drop the gelatine leaves into the water one by one to prevent sticking.",
   "When the gelatine leaves are soft, squeeze out the excess water and add to the warm cream mixture, whisking until the gelatine has dissolved. Whisk in half the yogurt – the mixture will start to thicken as the yogurt cools the cream. Pour the panna cotta mixture into a trifle bowl (ours was 20cm in diameter and 15cm deep). Chill for at least 2 hrs until the panna cotta has set.",
   "Meanwhile, halve 10 of the peaches and remove the stones. Arrange the peaches cut-side up in a saucepan. Tip in the honey, cardamom pods, orange juice, orange blossom water (if using) and 75g caster sugar, then pour over enough water to just cover the peaches. Cut a circle of baking parchment to fit neatly over the peaches and place it directly on the surface of the liquid to stop the peaches from bobbing around too much as they cook. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 20-30 mins until the peaches are soft enough to squash against the side of the pan with a spoon (the timing will depend on the firmness of the fruit). Leave to cool in the syrup.",
   "When the peaches have cooled, scoop onto a plate using a slotted spoon. Slip off the skins and discard them. Strain the peach syrup into a measuring jug – you should have about 600ml, but top up with orange juice if needed. If you have more than 600ml, you can keep the excess in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week to use in drinks.",
   "Warm the peach syrup in a saucepan over a low heat or the microwave until just steaming. Meanwhile, soak the remaining three gelatine leaves in cold water for 5 mins until soft. Squeeze any excess water from the gelatine, then stir into the hot syrup until dissolved. Set aside to cool until just warm.",
   "Cut the madeira loaf into 2-3cm cubes and arrange over the panna cotta layer in the trifle bowl. Pour over the peach syrup and chill for another 1-2 hrs, or until the syrup has set into a jelly.",
   "Arrange the poached peaches over the jelly layer, placing any pretty coral-pink pieces against the glass side. Pour the custard over the peaches, then chill until you’re ready to serve – we recommend chilling for at least 2 hrs, but it can also be chilled overnight to get ahead.",
   "When you’re ready to serve, beat the remaining 300ml double cream with the icing sugar to soft peaks using an electric whisk. Swirl though the remaining yogurt. Spoon the cream mixture over the custard layer, starting around the edge of the bowl, then filling in the middle. Halve, stone and finely slice the remaining two peaches, then arrange the slices on top and drizzle with some honey. Sprinkle over the chopped pistachios and nestle in shards of honeycomb, if you like."

  "Method": [
   "First, make the pastry. Tip the flour, 50g almonds, butter, sugar and ¼ tsp salt into a food processor. Blend until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Beat the egg yolks with 2 tbsp cold water, drizzle over the flour and butter mixture and blend again until the dough starts to clump together. Tip onto a work surface and knead briefly to bring everything together into a smooth dough. Divide into two pieces and shape each lump into a puck shape. Wrap and chill for 30 mins. Will keep, wrapped and chilled, for up to two days.",
   "Remove the stones from the cherries – either cut them in half and pop out each stone, or use a cherry stoner. Toss the cherries with the jam, sugar and cornflour until there are no floury patches. ",
   "If the pastry has been chilled for longer than 30 mins, bring it out of the fridge 20 mins or so before rolling, as it will be very firm. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Dust a surface with a little flour, then unwrap one piece of pastry. Carefully roll it out until it’s large enough to line the base and sides of a 25cm pie dish, skillet pan or cake tin. The pastry will be very delicate, if any cracks appear when rolling, squash them back together and keep going. Lift the pastry over the rolling pin and into the dish – don’t worry if it breaks, just patch it up by pushing it into the corners and up the sides and closing any holes. There should be a little overhang around the edges. Sprinkle the reserved 2 tbsp almonds over the base, then spread the cherries on top to fill the pie in an even layer. ",
   "Roll out the remaining pastry so it’s large enough to cover the pie. Brush a little beaten egg white around the pastry edge. Top the pie with the pastry lid as it is (piercing a hole in the centre for the steam to escape), or make a lattice topping. To do this, cut the pastry into strips, however wide you like. Arrange half the strips in one direction over the pie, leaving a few centimetres gap between each. Weave the remaining strips under and over these in the opposite direction, creating a lattice pattern. Squash the pastry together around the edge, then trim the excess with a sharp knife.",
   "Crimp the edge for a neat finish, or use any pastry scraps to make shapes to run around the edge – we used a piping nozzle to cut small circles. Stick them on with a little more egg wash, then brush the whole pie with a thin layer of egg wash. Sprinkle over a little caster sugar. Bake for 55 mins-1 hr, checking the pie after 40 mins. The edges may brown more quickly than the centre, if this happens, wrap a little kitchen foil around the edge to protect it. ",
   "Remove from the oven and leave to cool for 1 hr. If you cut it too soon, the fruit juice will be very runny and flood the pie. Best served just warm with cream or ice cream."

Tip in the remaining ingredients and set the pan over a low heat. Whisk until the butter has melted, then, using a wooden spoon, stir until the curd has thickened, about 10 mins. (Don’t turn up the heat to speed up the process, as the eggs will curdle.) Stir well, especially at the edge, as this is where the curd can catch. Sieve into a bowl, leave to cool, then spoon into the case. Chill the filled tart for 30 mins.",
   "To make the ganache, melt the chocolate, cream, sugar and a pinch of sea salt in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bowl doesn’t touch the water, stirring until glossy and thick. Remove from the heat, leave to cool for 15 mins, then pour over the curd layer. Scatter over the cocoa nibs, if using, then chill for at least 4 hrs, or overnight. Dust with cocoa, then slice and serve with crème fraîche."

Tip in the flour mixture and quickly beat with a wooden spoon until everything comes together into a smooth, shiny dough that pulls away from the side of the pan. Tip the dough into a clean bowl, and spread it up the side with the spoon to help it quickly cool down a bit (you don’t want it to cool completely – it’s easier to incorporate the eggs while it’s still a bit warm). Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and line two baking sheets with baking parchment. Set aside.",
   "While the dough is still slightly warm, crack in the eggs one at a time, beating well with the wooden spoon between each addition until smooth (you may not need to use all the eggs). When ready, the dough should slowly fall off the spoon in a V-shape – if the mixture is too runny, you won’t be able to pipe it; if it’s too thick, it won’t puff up in the oven. Spoon the dough into a piping bag and snip off the end so it has a 1cm opening.",
   "Holding the piping bag at a 90-degree angle to the baking tray, pipe walnut-sized balls of dough over the two sheets – you should get 18-20 in total. Dip your finger in a little water and gently pat down any peaks on top of the balls. Bake for 30-35 mins, swapping the trays over after 20 mins. The choux buns should be puffed up and crisp when cooked. Leave to cool completely.",
   "To make the filling, beat the cream with the biscuit spread and spices in a large bowl using an electric whisk until softly whipped.",
   "For the caramel sauce, tip the sugar into a saucepan set over a medium heat, add 6 tbsp water and cook until the sugar has dissolved. Turn up the heat slightly and simmer, swirling the pan occasionally until golden (do not stir or the sugar will crystallise). Remove from the heat, add the butter and swirl the pan until the butter has melted and combined with the syrup. Quickly beat in the cream, vanilla, cinnamon, mixed spice and a pinch of sea salt. Leave to cool slightly.",
   "Cut each cooled choux bun in half through the middle. Spoon the filling into a piping bag, snip off the end and pipe over the bases of the buns. Sandwich these with the tops, then arrange in a roughly 27cm round wreath shape on a large serving plate or board. Drizzle all over with the caramel sauce, then scatter over the crumbled biscuits and gold sprinkles, if using. Best eaten straightaway. Will keep chilled for up to 24 hrs."

   "To assemble, roll the marzipan out to a circle that fits the tart base and lay over the bottom. Spread the jam over the marzipan, then spread over the frangipane. Bake the tart for 45-50 mins until puffed up, golden and set with a very slight wobble. Trim any overhanging pastry and leave to cool.",
   "To make the drizzle, mix the icing sugar with the lemon juice in a bowl until you have a thick and drizzly icing. Carefully remove the tart from the tin, drizzle with the icing and scatter with the remaining almonds. Slice and serve with fresh raspberries and clotted cream, if you like."

Trim away the overhanging pastry, pour in the filling and bake for 25-30 mins until just set with a very slight wobble. Leave to cool completely in the tin and chill for at least 1 hr.

Pour the cassis and red wine over the pears, sprinkle with the sugar and tuck the bay leaves under the fruit.",
   "Bake – spooning the juices over the pears from time to time – until the fruits are tender right through to the centre (how long this takes depends on the ripeness of the fruit; start checking after 20 mins, but it could take as long as 45 mins). It’s a good idea to turn the pears over a couple of times while they’re cooking so that they are cut-side down in the liquor for part of the cooking time.",
   "By the time the fruit is cooked, the juice around it won’t be thick, but should be syrupy and sweet enough to serve as it is. If you don’t think it is, then remove the pears and bay leaves and reduce the juices by boiling them for a little while, leave to cool, then pour them back into the dish with the pears. Leave at room temperature and add the berries about 30 mins before you want to serve, spooning the juices over them, otherwise they get very soft sitting in the red wine syrup."

   "Butter and line the bases of three 18cm cake tins. Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Blend the butter and sugar in a food processor until smooth and creamy. Add the eggs, flour and yogurt and blend again. Add 200g strawberries (save the best ones to decorate) and the vanilla. Blend once more, until the mixture is well combined.",
   "Divide the cake batter evenly between the three cake tins. Spread and smooth the tops with a spatula, then bake for 25-30 mins, until the cakes have risen and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Return to the oven for another 5 mins if any wet mixture clings to the skewer. Leave in the tins for 5 mins, then turn onto a wire rack and leave to cool completely. The cakes can be made up to two days before icing, or frozen for two months.",
   "For the icing, blend the butter and half the sugar until smooth and creamy, add the soft cheese and the remaining sugar and blend again. Be careful not to over mix as the icing will become runny. (If you do overmix, don’t worry – keep mixing with an electric whisk and it’ll thicken back up).",
   "Layer the cakes with the jam and half the icing. Invert the final cake on top, so the base of the cake it now the top, giving you a flat surface. Pile the rest of the icing on top of the cake, using a palette knife to spread the icing over the top and down the sides. Save a little icing to pipe rosettes around the edge of the cake, if you like. Top with the remaining strawberries. Can be made up to a day ahead of serving, keep somewhere cool or in the fridge. Will keep for three days. "

   "Pour the cream and milk into a pan, then set over a low heat until just below boiling point. Take off the heat. Beat the egg yolks with the honey in a bowl until the mixture is pale, light and almost foamy. Gradually pour in the warm cream and milk, stirring all the time.",
   "Half-fill a large bowl with cold water and ice, then set another bowl inside that one. This will help cool the custard down later and stop it cooking as soon as it’s thick enough.",
   "Pour the custard mixture into a heavy-bottomed saucepan, then add a pinch of salt and set over a low heat, stirring with a wooden spoon until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of it. It’s important that you don’t overheat the mixture or the egg yolks will scramble. You will feel, as you’re stirring, that the texture of the mixture changes – it becomes silky and slightly thicker. At this stage, pour the custard into the bowl set in the iced water. Stir in the vanilla, whisky and lemon juice, then leave to cool, stirring from time to time.",
   "Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Mix the oats, maple syrup and a pinch of salt together in a bowl, then spread out on a baking sheet lined with baking parchment. Bake for 10 mins. Break up any clumps of sticky oats, then return to the oven and bake another 5 mins, or until golden brown. Leave to cool for 10 mins, then break the mixture up into small chips.",
   "For the ripple, put the raspberries in a saucepan with 1 tbsp water and cook over a low heat until they break down into a purée (press the berries with the back of a spoon to help them collapse). Push the purée through a sieve, discard the seeds, then mix in the sugar and glucose.",
   "Churn the custard in an ice cream maker, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Once it holds its shape, add two thirds of the toasted oats. If you do not have an ice cream maker, pour the custard into a freezer-proof container, put it in the freezer, then take out once every hour and blitz in a food processor. Do this three times, folding in the oats after the final blitzing.",
   "When the ice cream is frozen, but not too hard, transfer a third of it to a freezer-proof container. (If you haven’t used an ice cream maker, you’ll need a second freezer-proof container). Using a cocktail stick or a skewer, gently swirl the raspberry purée through it. Do the same with the next two thirds of the ice cream and raspberry purée. Top with the remaining toasted oat mixture, then cover and leave in the freezer overnight before serving."

Immediately turn off the heat, tip in the sifted flour and beat vigorously with a wooden spoon until you a have a smooth dough that comes away from the sides of the pan. Spread over a large dinner plate to cool to hand temperature.",
   "Allow to cool for a few minutes, then gradually add the eggs, mixing well between each addition until the mixture reluctantly drops off the spoon. Don’t add all the egg unless you need to.",
   "Cut two large sheets of baking parchment. On each one draw two sets of ‘track’ lines with a 10cm gap – these will be your guidelines so your eclairs will all be roughly the same size. Use the paper to line two large baking sheets – penside down. ",
   "Spoon your choux mixture into a piping bag with a 1cm star or round wide nozzle, or into a disposable piping bag with a similar-size hole snipped off for piping. Pipe two rows of well-spaced, squashed ‘S’ shapes on each sheet between the guidelines. Bake, one tray at a time, on a high-ish shelf for 25 mins, reducing temperature to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 as soon as they go in the oven.",
   "After 25 mins, poke a hole in the end of each bun, or using a small serrated knife, split down the middle and return to the oven, upside-down, to dry out for 5 mins until crisp and golden. Set aside to cool.",
   "While the buns are cooling, finish your filling. Whisk the cream until thick, then use your electric whisk to beat the cooled, set custard until just smooth again. Fold in the cream. Spoon your filling into a piping bag – use a small nozzle if you’re filling the buns through the holes you've pierced, or a large nozzle if you’ve split the buns in half. Carefully pipe the custard into each cooled bun – they should feel heavy once full. ",
   "To make the icing, melt 100g plain chocolate and 25g butter together in a heatproof bowl over a pan of barely simmering water. Once melted, remove from the heat and stir in 75ml double cream and 1 tbsp sifted icing sugar. Once cooled a little, spread over the tops of the buns and leave to cool."

Top with the raspberry compote, pushing the whole biscuits into it around the edges of the bowl. Spoon over the whipped cream, then decorate with the sprinkles and cherries, if you like. Will keep in the fridge for up to three days."

   "The night before you make the pastries, wrap 120g butter in foil and freeze until solid. Combine the flour, icing sugar and ¼ tsp salt in a large bowl. Add the chopped butter and rub into the flour mixture until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in 7 tbsp very cold water (if it still seems a little dry, add an extra 2 tbsp). Lightly knead the dough until it just comes together, then roll out on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle. Using a coarse cheese grater, grate half the frozen butter over the middle and bottom thirds of the pastry. Fold down the top third and fold up the bottom third, as if folding a letter. Turn the pastry 90 degrees and repeat with the rest of the frozen butter. Wrap and chill for at least 30 mins.",

Gradually whisk in the milk mixture in several additions, then pour into a clean pan set over a low heat. Cook, stirring continuously, until the custard is thick. Simmer for 2 mins more, then stir in a small pinch of sea salt. Transfer to a bowl and leave to cool. Once cooled, tip into a food processor with the pistachio paste and blitz until smooth. Put in a bowl and set aside.",
   "Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6. Put the plums in a roasting tin, cut-side down. Sprinkle over the sugar and vanilla. Roast for 15 mins until softened but holding their shape. Set aside to cool. Turn the oven up to 220C/200C fan/gas 8.",
   "Roll the chilled pastry out on a lightly floured surface to a rectangle of about 38 x 24cm. Trim the sides with a sharp knife, then cut the pastry into eight 11 x 10cm rectangles. Score a 1cm border around each, then put on a baking tray lined with baking parchment (you may need two trays). Brush with the beaten egg, then chill for 15 mins. Bake for 20 mins. Push down the centres, then pipe or spoon in the pistachio custard and top each with a plum half. Bake for 10-15 mins more. Finely chop the rest of the pistachios and scatter them over the warm pastries. Leave to cool completely before serving."

Transfer the crumbs to a bowl, then pour over the melted butter. Mix thoroughly until the crumbs are completely coated. Tip them into the prepared tin and press firmly down into the base to create an even layer. Chill in the fridge for 1 hr to set firmly.For more detail on how to make a biscuit base, take a look at our how to make a biscuit base video.",

Place the soft cheese, icing sugar and the vanilla seeds in a separate bowl, then beat for 2 mins with an electric mixer until smooth and starting to thicken, it will get thin and then start to thicken again. Tip in the double cream and fold it into the soft cheese mix. You’re looking for it to be thickened enough to hold its shape when you tip a spoon of it upside down. If it’s not thick enough, continue to whisk. Spoon onto the biscuit base, starting from the edges and working inwards, making sure that there are no air bubbles. Smooth the top of the cheesecake down with the back of a dessert spoon or spatula. Leave to set in the fridge overnight.",
   "Bring the cheesecake to room temperature about 30 mins before serving. To remove it from the tin, place the base on top of a can, then gradually pull the sides of the tin down. Slip the cake onto a serving plate, removing the lining paper and base. Purée half the strawberries in a blender or food processor with the icing sugar and 1 tsp water, then sieve. Pile the remaining strawberries onto the cake, and pour the purée over the top."

   "Mix the flour, ¼ tsp salt, the baking powder and sugar together in a bowl. Rub the butter in using your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Or, gradually pulse the ingredients together in a food processor.",
   "Gradually stir the milk and almond extract into the flour mixture using your hands until you have a smooth dough. Lightly dust the work surface with flour and gently roll the dough out to a 2cm thickness. Transfer to a baking tray lined with baking parchment and chill for 30 mins to firm up, or up to 1 hr if you want to get ahead.",
   "Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and remove the dough from the fridge. Stamp out three or four scones using a 7cm round cutter. Place, upside-down, on a baking sheet lined with baking parchment, leaving a 2cm gap between each. Roll the remaining dough out again and stamp out as many scones as you can (you should get about six in total). Brush the scones with the beaten egg, making sure it doesn’t drip down the sides as this will cause the scones to rise unevenly. Sprinkle over the flaked almonds. Bake for 10-15 mins until golden brown. Leave to cool completely. Will keep frozen in an airtight container for up to three months.",
   "For the topping, mix the icing sugar with 1-2 tbsp water. Drizzle over the scones and top each one with a cherry. These are delicious to eat as they are, or serve with jam and clotted cream, if you like."

Chill the cooled cheesecake until you want to serve it. Will keep in the fridge forup to three days. Decorate just before serving.",

Fill how you like. My personal favourite is a good dollop of lemon curd and some fresh cream, then dust the top with icing sugar. Will keep for 3 days."

   "Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter a 20cm square baking tin and line with two criss-crossed, overlapping strips of baking parchment (this will help you remove the traybake later). Put the strawberries in a food processor or mini chopper and blitz to a purée. Tip into a small saucepan and simmer for 3 mins until slightly reduced. Pour into a bowl and leave to cool.",
   "Beat the butter and sugar together in a bowl using an electric whisk (or do this in a stand mixer) for 4-5 mins until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in the eggs, one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract. Mix in the flour and baking powder.",
   "Divide the cake batter between three bowls, weighing for accuracy, if you like. Mix the cocoa and 2 tbsp milk into the first bowl until smooth and combined. Mix the cooled strawberry purée and a drop of pink food colouring into the second bowl, and stir the remaining milk into the last bowl.",
   "Drop alternating spoonfuls of the three batters into the prepared tin until all three have been used up (an ice cream scoop is useful for this). Try not to mix the colours together, but spread each blob out slightly using the back of the spoon. It’s easiest to use three separate spoons to prevent colours mixing, or rinse the spoon before moving to a different coloured batter.",
   "Bake for 30-35 mins until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for 15 mins, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely. Once cool, will keep covered in the fridge for up to three days. Next, make the topping. Whisk the cream and icing sugar together to soft peaks – it should be thick and spreadable. Spoon the topping into a piping bag fitted with a star nozzle, if you like. Or, you can spoon on the topping.",
   "Cut the cooled sponge into 16 even squares, then pipe or spoon a dollop of the topping over each. Decorate each square with a chocolate flake before serving."

Scatter over the clafoutis, then sieve a little icing sugar over the top. Leave to sit for 10-15 mins (the clafoutis will deflate a little). Serve warm with crème fraîche or pouring cream."

   "Leave the cake to cool in its tin for 20 mins, then carefully turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. It will be delicate so be gentle. The sponge will keep, covered, at room temperature for up to two days.",
   "For the vegan buttercream, melt the chocolate in the microwave or a bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Leave to cool. Beat the spread and vanilla on high speed in a stand mixer for a few minutes until pale and fluffy. Add the icing sugar gradually, beating on slow to start with, then turning up the speed to max until the mixture is light and creamy. Pour in the cooled chocolate and combine thoroughly, add a splash of plant milk if the icing is very stiff. Chill the buttercream for at least 30 mins before using.",
   "When the cake is completely cool, spread the icing over the top and decorate with the sprinkles, if you like. Keep the cake in the fridge to stay firm, then remove 1 hr before serving. Will keep, covered, in the fridge, for up to three days."

  "Ingredients": [
   [
    "1 x 411g jar mincemeat",
    "100g pistachios , chopped",
    "100g ground almonds",
    "1 orange , zested",
    "150g butter",

   "For the syrup"
  ],
  "Method": [
   "Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Mix the mincemeat with the pistachios, almonds, orange zest and a good pinch of salt, then set aside. Melt the butter, then use a little to brush the bottom and sides of a 20 x 30cm baking tin. Cut the sheets of filo so they’re the same size as the tin, then cover with a damp tea towel to stop them from drying out.",
   "Press one sheet of filo pastry into the tin and brush with the melted butter. Continue to layer the pastry in this way until you have used up one pack of pastry (around 10 sheets). Evenly spread the mincemeat mixture over. Top with the remaining pastry, continuing to brush the layers with melted butter as you go. Brush the final layer generously with melted butter. Using a very sharp knife, cut deep, diagonal lines all the way through the pastry to form a diamond pattern. Bake in the oven for 1 hr until golden.",
   "Meanwhile, make the syrup. Put the sugar and 75ml water into a saucepan, and cook over a low heat until the sugar has dissolved. Simmer until the syrup is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat and stir in the Grand Marnier or brandy. Once the baklava has baked, remove from the oven and increase the temperature to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Pour the syrup over the baklava, then return it to the oven for 5 mins or until the syrup has been absorbed. Leave to cool completely in the tin, then slice into pieces along the diagonal lines. Will keep for up to one week in an airtight container."

Leave to cool in the tin for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack, remove the parchment and leave to cool completely. Or, to make a round cake, see our tip below.",

Transfer the mixture to two small piping bags fitted with star and round nozzles. Use a cocktail stick, knife or spoon dipped in the food colouring to paint the inside of the bags in stripes up the length, painting each bag with a different colour and leaving the area nearest the nozzle uncoloured, then fill with meringue. Cover a baking sheet with parchment, using a little of the meringue on the underside to stick it to the tray. Pipe blobs onto it, well spaced apart, to make meringue kisses – they will come out plain first. Bake for 30 mins, then turn off the oven and leave the meringues inside to cool to room temperature. Decorate them with gold leaf or glitter, if you like.",

   "Beat the buttercream ingredients together using an electric whisk until you get a pale, fluffy icing. Transfer to a large piping bag with a wide, round nozzle.",
   "To cut the sponge into a tree shape, first split the cooled cake into two layers using a cake cutter or serrated knife. Using a ruler or a sheet of baking parchment the same width as the cake, mark a halfway point at the top end of the cake. At the bottom end of the cake, mark it into thirds. Using these as a guide, cut squares from the bottom end of the cake, leaving a centre section for the tree stump, then cut from your middle mark at the top down to the bottom edges to create a Christmas tree shape. Use the off-cuts to make cake pops, or in trifle. Carefully lift off the top sponge using a baking sheet, and pipe blobs of buttercream all over, starting from the outside edge. Chill for 20 mins to firm up. Pipe some of the jam between the buttercream blobs, except the outer edge.",
   "Position the remaining cake on top, and pipe more icing blobs all over. Add the frosted leaves, frosted and plain cherries, ginger biscuits (see our recipe) and meringues, sprinkle a little glitter over the un-frosted cherries, and pipe on the remaining jam in blobs. Add the biscuits, putting a star-shaped one at the top, and add gold leaf, if you like. Will keep, well covered in the fridge, for two-three days."

Crimp the edges using a fork to seal, then use the tip of a knife to lightly cut three lines across the top of the pies so that steam can escape during cooking.",

   "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Oil and line a 900g loaf tin with baking parchment. Whisk the oil, yogurt, eggs and vanilla in a jug. Mix the flour, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg with a good pinch of salt in a bowl. Squeeze any lumps of sugar through your fingers, shaking the bowl a few times to bring the lumps to the surface.",
   "Add the wet ingredients to the dry, along with the carrots, raisins and half the pistachios. Mix well to combine, then scrape into the tin. Bake for 1 hr 10 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. If any wet mixture clings to the skewer, return to the oven for 5 mins, then check again. Leave to cool in the tin.",
   "To make the icing, beat the butter and sugar together until smooth. Add half the cream cheese and beat again, then add the rest (adding it bit by bit prevents the icing from splitting). Remove the cake from the tin and spread the icing thickly on top. Scatter with some of the remaining pistachios. Dye the fondant or marzipan orange by kneading in a drop of food colouring. Roll into little carrot shapes, then use a skewer to make indentations and poke a few pistachios in to look like fronds. Top the cake with the carrots, then serve. Will keep in the fridge for up to five days (eat at room temperature)."

Bring to a simmer, add the apples and cook for 10-15 mins until they’re starting to soften – it will be quite saucy. Add a generous pinch of salt, taste and check the balance, adding more if you like. If your pan isn’t ovenproof, pour into a baking dish about 20 x 30cm, or two smaller ones.",
   "Tip the flour into a bowl. Mix with the baking powder, sugar, cinnamon and a pinch of salt. Rub the butter into the mixture with your fingertips until it resembles damp sand. Add the milk, stir with a cutlery knife until it starts to clump together, then use your hands to bring the dough together, picking up any flaky bits. Don’t overwork it or your dumplings will be heavy. Divide into 12 golf ball-sized pieces and roll into dumplings. Arrange over the apples, leaving little gaps here and there. Sprinkle with a little extra sugar (brown or caster) and bake for 25 mins until the dumplings are puffed up and golden. Let rest for a few mins and serve with plenty of cold cream."

Pour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with a spatula, moving the bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a dark brown. Try not to knock the air out. ",

Gently fold in this powder as well as the espresso mixture using the same figure-of- eight action as before. The mixture will look dry and dusty at first; keep going until it looks fudgy, but don’t overdo this mixing. Pour the mixture into the tin and gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it. Push the chocolate balls into the brownie at regular intervals.",

   "Put 150g water and all the dough ingredients, apart from the butter, into the bowl of a mixer with a beater paddle. Mix on a medium speed for 8 mins or until the dough starts coming away from the sides and forms a ball. Turn off the mixer and let the dough rest for 1 min.",
   "Start the mixer up again on a medium speed and slowly add the butter to the dough – about 25g at a time. Once it's all incorporated, mix on high speed for 5 mins until the dough is glossy, smooth and very elastic when pulled.",
   "Cover the bowl with cling film or a clean tea towel and leave to prove until it's doubled in size. Knock back the dough in the bowl briefly, then re-cover and put in the fridge to chill overnight.",
   "The next day, take the dough out of the fridge and cut it into 50g pieces (you should get about 20).",
   "Roll the dough pieces into smooth, tight buns and place them on a floured baking tray, leaving plenty of room between them, as you don’t want them to stick together while they prove.",
   "Cover loosely with cling film and leave for 4 hrs or until doubled in size. Fill your deep-fat fryer or heavy-based saucepan halfway with oil. Heat the oil to 180C. Read our guide on how to deep-fry safely for more essential information. ",
   "When the oil is heated, carefully slide the doughnuts from the tray using a floured pastry scraper. Taking care not to deflate them, put them into the oil. Do 2-3 per batch, depending on the size of your fryer or pan.",
   "Fry for 2 mins each side until golden brown – they puff up and float, so you may need to gently push them down after about 1 min to help them colour evenly.",
   "Remove the doughnuts from the fryer and place them on kitchen paper.",
   "Toss the doughnuts in a bowl of caster sugar while still warm. Repeat the steps until all the doughnuts are fried, but keep checking the oil temperature is correct – if it's too high, they will burn and be raw in the middle; if it's too low, the oil will be absorbed into the doughnuts and they will become greasy. Set aside to cool before filling.",
   "To fill the doughnuts, make a hole with a small knife in the crease of each one, anywhere around the white line between the fried top and bottom.",
   "Fill a piping bag with jam and pipe into the doughnut until nicely swollen – about 1 tbsp per doughnut. After filling, the doughnuts are best eaten straight away, but will keep in an airtight tin."

Carefully put them on a baking tray lined with baking parchment. Cut the brownies into nine portions. Put a piece of brownie on each plate, top each with a ball of ice cream, then top with a chocolate dome. Gently reheat the butterscotch sauce. At the table, pour the hot sauce over the dome for extra pizazz, to reveal the brownie inside."

If the brownie mixture is very wobbly in the middle, it’s not quite done, so bake for another 5 -10 mins, or until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning to come away from the tin. Take out of the oven and leave to cool in the tin. Dust with icing sugar. Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into four squares.

   "Heat the oven to 190C/170 fan/gas 5. Toss the apples with 2 tbsp golden caster sugar and put in a 23cm round baking dish at least 5cm deep, or a 20cm square dish. Flatten down with your hand.",
   "For the crumble topping, mix the flour and sugar in a bowl with a good pinch of salt. Rub the dairy-free spread in with your fingertips until the mixture looks like moist breadcrumbs. Shake the bowl and any big bits will come to the surface – rub these in too. ",
   "Pour the crumble mix over the apples to form a pile in the centre, then use a fork to even out. Gently press the surface with the back of the fork so the crumble holds together and goes crisp, then lightly drag the fork over the top for a decorative finish. Sprinkle the oats and demerara sugar over evenly. ",
   "Place on a baking tray and put in the oven for 35-40 mins, until the top is golden and the apples feel very soft when you insert a small, sharp knife. Leave to cool for 10 mins before serving."

   "Pour the oil and the orange juice into a jug and mix together. Put the eggs and sugar in a tabletop mixer or large bowl and whisk together for 5-10 mins or until the mixture has tripled in volume and holds a ribbon on the surface when the beaters are lifted out. Slowly pour the oil mixture into the egg mixture and fold together until combined.",
   "Add the flour mixture to the egg mixture in 3 or 4 additions, folding together until combined. You can’t sieve this mixture over the eggs because of the hazelnuts, but try not to dump the flour in one place – you need to be careful and fold the batter to retain its lightness. Once fully combined, pour the batter into the prepared loaf tin and bake for 50-55 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.",
   "Prick the top of the cake all over, then pour over 5 tbsp of the reserved orange syrup. Cool in the tin for 15 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Trim the top of the cake (keep this for a mini trifle) and turn out, cut-side down, onto a serving platter.",
   "To decorate, pour the orange juice into a small pan and bring to a simmer. Put the chocolate in a small bowl, pour the orange juice over and stir together to form a smooth ganache. Set aside in the fridge until thickened, about 20-25 mins. Tip the hazelnuts into a small bowl and add the gold powder with a dash of water, stirring together to coat. Put the ganache in a piping bag fitted with a small round piping tip. Pipe in peaks over the top of the cake, decorating with the golden hazelnuts and the orange slices.

    "6 tbsp strawberry jam or conserve",

  "Method": [
   "Remove the base of a 20cm loose-bottomed cake tin (make sure it’s a deep one) and use it as a template to cut out a circle from each flan case. Chop the offcuts from the flans into small pieces and set aside. Reassemble the tin and line it with a couple of sheets of cling film, leaving enough overhanging to wrap up once the tin is filled.",
   "Put one flan disc in the base of the tin and spread over half the jam. Arrange the strawberries around the outside with the cut surface facing outwards. If you have any particularly large or small strawberries, put them to one side.",
   "Whip the cream, 2 tbsp icing sugar and 3 tbsp elderflower cordial together in a bowl until the mixture holds its shape. Chop the reserved strawberries, then fold them into the cream mixture. Use half of the cream to fill the centre of the gateau, spreading right to the edges so it holds the strawberries in place.",
   "Push a single layer of the chopped flan offcuts into the cream (you may have some leftovers to nibble on), and drizzle over the remaining elderflower cordial. Stir the remaining jam through the rest of the cream, spread it over the flan pieces, and top with the final piece of flan. Fold over the cling film and give the gateau a gentle press down to compact the layers. Chill while you make the icing. Can be chilled for up to 24 hrs.",
   "Crush the raspberries with the back of a fork and stir in the 150g icing sugar to make a thick icing. Add a splash of water if it’s too thick. Alternatively, add enough water to the icing sugar to make a thick icing, then stir in a few drops of pink food colouring.",
   "When you’re ready to serve, remove the cake from the tin and discard the cling film, then transfer to a cake stand. Spread the icing right to the edges, then scatter the pistachios in a ring around the top, if using, and serve with a little strawberry coulis or cream on the side, if you like."

   "Take the plantain out of the oven and, once cool enough to handle, scoop the flesh into a bowl. Mix the flour with the remaining sugar, then mix in the plantain flesh. Stir in 150ml water gradually using a cutlery knife until you have a loose, sticky dough. Leave in a warm place, covered with a damp tea towel, for 1 hr or until doubled in size.",
   "Mix the condensed milk and coffee in a small bowl and set aside. Mix the ingredients for the dusting together in a wide, shallow bowl.",
   "Fill a heavy-based saucepan half-full with the oil, and gently heat to 180C. If you don’t have a thermometer, drop a small bit of batter into the oil. It’s ready when the batter drops to the bottom, then rises after 3-5 seconds. Wet your hands to stop the dough sticking, and take a small amount, about the size of a walnut, and carefully drop into the oil. Repeat, working in batches and ensuring there is space enough so the puffs aren’t touching. Cook for 2 mins or until golden brown, then turn and fry for another 2 mins until brown all over. Remove using a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper, then roll each puff in the dusting and transfer to a plate. Serve with the coffee sauce on the side, for dunking."

Continue whisking while you pour the hot milk over the egg yolks in a steady stream, until combined. Transfer back to the pan, and heat over a medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 10 mins. It shouldn’t be custard thick, more of a thick double cream consistency. Transfer to a bowl, cover the surface with a scrunched piece of baking parchment and leave to cool. Once cool, chill until ready to serve. ",
   "Put the egg white in a stand mixer. Whisk for 4-5 mins until you get soft peaks. With the motor still running, add the sugar 1 tbsp at a time, allowing it to be incorporated before adding the next. When all the sugar has been added, whisk for another 2-3 mins until stiff.",
   "Pour the milk and 200ml water into a wide pan or medium frying pan and heat until steaming, but not boiling. Add heaped teaspoons of the meringue mix into the milk, using another teaspoon to slide the meringue off the spoon, and gently poach for 3-4 mins (you don’t need to move them around). Carefully turn the meringues over and cook the other side for 3-4 mins until set. Remove the meringues from the milk and leave to cool on a plate.",
   "To make the caramel, heat the sugar, 1 tbsp water and pinch of salt in a small pan and cook on a medium heat until you get a lightly golden caramel, about 10 mins. Keep warm for drizzling at the end. ",
   "To serve, briefly stir, then spoon the custard into four ramekins or small bowls. Top each with a meringue and a drizzle of caramel."

   "Start by making the cakes. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line 2 x 18cm springform cake tins with baking parchment and brush with a little oil. Put the sugar and eggs in a large mixing bowl and whisk with electric beaters until glossy and pale. Keep the beaters running as you pour in the oil.",
   "Stir in the grated apple, then fold in all the other cake ingredients. Divide the mixture between the tins and bake for 30 mins or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.",
   "While the cakes cook, prepare the apple filling. Tip the lemon juice into a large bowl and fill halfway with cold water. Peel the apples, then cut into spheres using a melon baller – pop them in the bowl of lemon water as you go to stop them discolouring. In a medium saucepan, combine the butter, dark brown sugar, golden syrup, cinnamon and 200ml water, and heat until boiling. Take the apple balls out of the water and put them in the pan –if you want to make the tiny toffee apples for the top, keep 8 apple balls in the water until needed. Bring the mixture in the pan back to the boil for 8 - 10 mins or until the apples are soft but not losing their shape, and a thick syrup starts to form. Remove from the heat and allow to cool completely, then chill until needed.",
   "Stir all the syrup ingredients together in a bowl. When the cakes are cooked, keep them in the tin but prick holes all over the surface with a skewer and drizzle the syrup over. Leave the cakes to cool completely in the tin.",
   "While the cakes cool, make the icing. In a small heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, melt the butter and white chocolate together. Once melted and glossy, pour into a large bowl. Add the cream cheese, whisk until smooth, then add the vanilla. Finally, fold in the yogurt. When the mixture is cool, chill until needed.",
   "To assemble the cake, take the cooled sponges out of their tins and put one of them on a cake stand. Top with half the white chocolate icing – use a spoon or pipe it using a very large round nozzle. Scatter the cooked apple pieces, along with a drizzle of the syrup, over the icing, then place in the fridge to firm up for 15 mins. Add the top layer of the cake, then decorate with the rest of the icing by piping it in lots of regular little mounds all over the top using a large round nozzle. Put the whole cake in the fridge until ready to serve. Will keep for 2 days in the fridge.",
   "For a showstopping, but optional, finish, make some beautiful miniature toffee apples. Their effect is stunning but fleeting, so make them just before serving your cake, as the caramel will dissolve quickly due to the moisture in the air. Brush a baking tray with a little vegetable oil and set aside. Very thoroughly dry the reserved apple balls from step 3 of the cake with kitchen paper or a clean tea towel and insert a long wooden skewer into each one.",
   "Put the caster sugar in a small saucepan over a medium heat, stirring often, until the sugar melts. Keep cooking until the sugar has become a liquid golden caramel, then remove from the heat. If it looks like it’s getting too hot, sit the base of the pan in a heatproof dish of cold water.",
   "Tilt the pan and, working quickly (as the sugar will continue to cook), hold the apple balls by the skewer and dip each one in turn into the caramel and twist it around to coat it. It’s really important that the apple balls are well dried and that you don’t turn them in the hot caramel more than twice, otherwise the apple will cook and release liquid, which will stop the caramel from sticking. As soon as they are coated, slowly lift them out vertically. Hold the apple up out of the pan and pause before transferring it to the oiled tray on its side. Holding it up like this will allow a long drip of caramel to set hard and create a beautiful long spike. Repeat the process with the rest of the apples, working quickly so that the caramel doesn’t harden completely before all the apples have been coated. However, don’t worry too much as you can always gently reheat it over a low heat before continuing – just be careful not to burn it, otherwise it will taste bitter.",
   "After a couple of minutes, the apples should have set. When they are cool enough to handle, pull out the skewers. Place the apples on top of the cake so that the spike is pointing upwards and the base of the apple (where the skewer was) is pressed into the icing. Serve immediately."

Tip the dough out onto a floured surface, and knead for about 10 mins until springy. Alternatively, you can do this in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook – the dough will only require about 5 mins of kneading using this method. Bring the dough together into a ball, then place in an oiled bowl. Cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise for about 1 hr, or until doubled in size.",

Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly to knock the air out. Leave to rest for a few minutes, then roll out to a 30 x 50cm rectangle, and lay it on the surface so the short edge is facing you. Spread over the filling so the dough rectangle is completely covered. Cut the dough into four strips down the length. Roll the first strip up into a tight spiral from the short end, then place the spiral at the short end of the second strip and roll this up into a spiral around the first. Place this larger spiral at the short end of the third strip and roll up again, then repeat with the final strip of dough. You should end up with one large cinnamon bun. Transfer to the prepared tin, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise for 45 mins-1 hr, or until it has risen by about a third.",
   "Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Put the cake tin on a baking tray and bake for 50 mins-1 hr until puffed up, golden and cooked through. Meanwhile, combine the icing sugar, vanilla and 3 tbsp water until you have a loose icing that can be drizzled. Leave the bun to cool in the tin for 10 mins, then remove from the tin, drizzle with the icing and leave to cool completely on a wire rack. Serve in slices, or let everyone pull it apart. Will keep in an airtight container for two days."

   "Whisk the sugar, oil and vanilla extract together in a bowl, then whisk in the yogurt, making sure to break down any sugar lumps. Pour in the soured milk and mix well.",
   "Sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and ½ tsp salt into a separate bowl and stir well to combine. Gradually whisk the wet ingredients into the dry until you have a smooth batter, but be careful not to over-mix.",
   "Divide the batter evenly between the tins and bake for 25-30 mins, until well risen and springy, and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out almost clean. A few sticky crumbs are fine, but the mixture should not be wet.",
   "Leave the cakes to cool in their tins for 20 mins, then carefully turn them out onto a wire rack to cool completely. They will be delicate so be gentle (a cake lifter is helpful). The sponges will keep, covered, at room temperature for up to two days.",
   "For the vegan buttercream, melt the chocolate in the microwave or a bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Leave to cool. Beat the spread and vanilla on high speed in a stand mixer for a few minutes until pale and fluffy. Add the icing sugar gradually, beating on slow to start with, then turning up the speed to max until the mixture is light and creamy. Pour in the cooled chocolate and combine thoroughly. Chill the buttercream for at least 30 mins before using.",
   "To assemble the cake, first use a sharp knife to trim the tops off the sponges to make them level. Put one of the sponges on a serving plate, cake stand or 20cm round cake drum (using a cake drum makes it easier to ice the cake neatly and to move it onto a stand or plate later). Spread over a layer of the buttercream, using a palette knife to get an even, neat finish. Top with the second sponge and spread over another layer of buttercream.",
   "Top with the last sponge upside-down, so the bottom of the cake becomes the top (this will help to keep the icing neat and relatively crumb-free). Spread the sides of the cake with buttercream. Hold the top sponge steady with a palm if you need to stabilise the cake. Once you have the sides covered as neatly as you can, cover the top with a thin layer of buttercream. Use your palette knife to neaten the top and sides. If you have a side scraper, use it to sweep around the sides and top to sharpen the coating. (This is a crumb coat, trapping any crumbs to give you a neat, firm base.) Put the cake in the fridge to firm up and chill for 1-2 hrs.",
   "To finish, cover the sides and top of the cake in the same manner, using most of the remaining buttercream. Press the sprinkles up against the bottom of the cake, about a quarter to a third of the way up. You can dress the top of the cake with a circle of sprinkles, or for a fancier finish, pipe little swirls around the top edge of the cake using any remaining buttercream scraped into a piping bag fitted with a large open star nozzle, then finish with more sprinkles.",
   "Keep the cake in the fridge to stay firm, then remove 1 hr before serving. Will keep, covered, in the fridge, for up to three days."

Add the eggs, flour, almonds, baking powder, lemon zest, mixed spice and vanilla (all in one go) and mix until well combined. Mix in the cooled soaked dried fruit and fold in the cherries.",
   "Scrape half the cake mixture into the tin. Top with the disc of marzipan, then the remaining cake mixture, and level the top with a spatula. Bake for 2 hrs. Check it’s cooked by inserting a skewer to the centre of the cake, if any wet mixture clings to the skewer, return to the oven for another 10 mins, then check again. Cool in the tin for 15 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack and leave to cool completely. ",
   "Brush the top of the cake with apricot jam. Roll out half of the remaining marzipan and use the base of the cake as a template to cut out another disc. Place it on top of the cake and crimp the edges, if you like. Roll the remaining marzipan into 11 equal-sized balls for the apostles. Brush the marzipan with beaten egg and arrange the apostles in a circle on top around the outside, and brush them with a little egg too. Put under a hot grill for a minute or two until just starting to caramelise – be very careful as the marzipan will burn easily. Leave to cool and wrap a ribbon around the cake, if you like. Will keep for up to a week in a sealed tin. "

   "Cut 185g unsalted butter into small cubes and tip into a medium bowl. Break 185g dark chocolate into small pieces and drop into the bowl.",
   "Fill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water, then sit the bowl on top so it rests on the rim of the pan, not touching the water. Put over a low heat until the butter and chocolate have melted, stirring occasionally to mix them.",
   "Remove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with cling film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes on High. Leave the melted mixture to cool to room temperature.",
   "While you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of your oven and turn the oven on to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.",
   "Using a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of non-stick baking parchment to line the base. Tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder into a sieve held over a medium bowl. Tap and shake the sieve so they run through together and you get rid of any lumps.",
   "Chop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board.",
   "Break 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. With an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar. They will look thick and creamy, like a milk shake. This can take 3-8 minutes, depending on how powerful your mixer is. You’ll know it’s ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about double its original volume. Another check is to turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and wiggle them from side to side. If the mixture that runs off the beaters leaves a trail on the surface of the mixture in the bowl for a second or two, you’re there.",
   "Pour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with a rubber spatula. Plunge the spatula in at one side, take it underneath and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the middle. Continue going under and over in a figure of eight, moving the bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a mottled dark brown. The idea is to marry them without knocking out the air, so be as gentle and slow as you like.",
   "Hold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover the top evenly.",
   "Gently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight action as before. The mixture will look dry and dusty at first, and a bit unpromising, but if you keep going very gently and patiently, it will end up looking gungy and fudgy. Stop just before you feel you should, as you don’t want to overdo this mixing.",
   "Finally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they’re dotted throughout.",
   "Pour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the bowl with the spatula. Gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it.",
   "Put in the oven and set your timer for 25 mins. When the buzzer goes, open the oven, pull the shelf out a bit and gently shake the tin. If the brownie wobbles in the middle, it’s not quite done, so slide it back in and bake for another 5 minutes until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning to come away from the tin. Take out of the oven.",
   "Leave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you’re using the brownie tin, lift up the protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut brownie out on its base. If you’re using a normal tin, lift out the brownie with the foil. Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into four squares and finally into triangles.",
   "They’ll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the freezer for up to a month."

With the motor running, drizzle in 1-2 tbsp cold water until the dough starts to form in clumps. Squeeze a little between your fingers – if it feels like it will come together, tip the mixture onto your work surface and knead briefly into a ball. Shape into a disc, wrap and chill for 30 mins or overnight.",
   "If the pastry has been chilled for longer than 30 mins, let it come to room temperature for 20 mins before rolling. Mix the brown sugar, lemon zest, cornflour and maple syrup together in a large bowl. Add the apples and toss well. Set aside while you roll out the pastry.",
   "Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Dust a sheet of baking parchment large enough to line a large baking tray with flour, then roll the pastry out to a roughly 30cm circle on top of the parchment. The pastry will crack and crumble a little as you roll it, but just keep pushing the edges back together – don’t worry if it looks rustic. Slide the pastry on its parchment onto the baking tray. Pile the apple slices into the centre of the pastry circle using your hands, letting any excess syrup drip back into the bowl as you do (save the syrup for later). Be sure to leave a clear 2cm border around the edge. Use the baking parchment to help you lift the edges of the pastry over the apples, leaving the most of the apples exposed. Pinch together any cracks around the edge to make a rustic pastry border.",
   "Brush the pastry edge with some beaten egg, sprinkle with a little extra brown sugar and scatter over the hazelnuts. Bake for 50-55 mins until golden brown. Meanwhile, pour any leftover syrup from the apples into a small saucepan and bubble for a few minutes until syrupy. When the galette is cooked and still hot, brush the syrup over the top. Leave to cool for at least 30 mins, then serve warm with cold cream. Will keep in the fridge for up to two days, or freeze in well-wrapped slices for up to two months."

  "Method": [
   "Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6. Butter the base and sides of two 20cm cake tins (4cm deep) and line with baking parchment. Put the butter and sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat for 2-3 mins until pale, light and fluffy. Alternatively, do this in a bowl using an electric whisk. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well between each addition until fully incorporated.",
   "Mix the cocoa powder, vanilla extract and red food colouring gel together in a small bowl or jug with 2-3 tbsp hot water until you have a smooth, lump-free paste. Tip this into the bowl with the cake batter and whisk briefly to combine.",
   "Mix the vinegar and buttermilk together in a jug. Combine the flour, bicarb and 1 tsp salt in a bowl. Pour a third of the buttermilk mixture into the cake batter, then mix in along with a third of the flour mixture until fully incorporated. Alternate between the remaining buttermilk and flour mixtures, mixing these in a third at a time until everything is fully combined, being careful not to overmix.",
   "Divide the cake batter equally between the prepared tins and bake for 30-35 mins until the sponges spring back when gently pressed with a fingertip and a skewer inserted into the centre of each comes out clean. Do not open the oven before 25 mins have elapsed, as this can cause the sponges to sink in the centre. Leave to cool in the tins for 5 mins, then turn out onto wire racks to cool completely.",
   "To make the buttercream, clean out the bowl of the stand mixer, then tip in the butter and vanilla bean paste (or do this in a bowl using an electric whisk). Beat on high speed for about 1 min until creamy and smooth. Gradually add the icing sugar, about a quarter at a time, beating between each addition on a low speed until just incorporated. When all the icing sugar has been added, turn the speed up to high and beat for 1 min. Turn the speed back down to low, then tip in the soft cheese and beat until just combined and smooth.",
   "Split both of the cooled sponges through the middle using a cake leveller or large bread knife so you have four equally sized, thin layers. Spread a little buttercream over the middle of a 20cm round cake board and top with a sponge layer. Spread buttercream generously over the top of the sponge layer so it sticks out over the edge slightly. Top with a second sponge layer and repeat until you’ve used all the sponges, inverting the final sponge layer so that the top is flat. Spread any buttercream that’s sticking out from between the sponge layers all around the side of the cake using a palette knife to seal the stack.",
   "Next, spread a thin, even layer of buttercream over the whole cake down to the cake board to seal it completely. Once you have covered the whole cake, clean the palette knife and go around the cake again to smooth the sides and remove any excess. This is called a crumb coat, which seals in any crumbs and will make the finished cake look neater. Chill the cake for at least 30 mins until firm and set.",
   "Spoon 300g of the remaining buttercream into a bowl and keep chilled to pipe with later. Spoon the rest of the buttercream over the top of the chilled cake (reserving a little to secure the cake to a cake stand), then use a palette knife to spread it to the edge and encourage it to drop slightly over the side. Then, hold the palette knife vertically against the side of the cake and smooth over the buttercream, turning the cake as you go so the side is covered in a thick, even layer (a cake turntable can help with this, if you have one, or see our tip, right). Once you’ve covered the side, you may wish to clean the palette knife and smooth the top and side again to ensure the buttercream is neat, or do this with a side scraper if you have one. Transfer the cake, on its board, to a cake stand using the reserved buttercream to secure it in place.",
   "Place the cake, on its stand, on a baking tray (this will catch any excess sprinkles). Press most of the sprinkles around the bottom third of the cake in a thick band, sticking a few up the side in places so it looks as though some have floated away from the band. Use a cutlery or palette knife to gently press the sprinkles into the cake to ensure they’re secure, then carefully brush any excess from the stand using a pastry brush. Chill for 30 mins.",
   "Meanwhile, prepare the shimmering chocolate truffles, if using. Tip a few teaspoons of gold lustre dust into a small bowl, then do the same with the pink lustre dust in another bowl. Divide the chocolate truffles between the two bowls and turn with your fingertips or a teaspoon until fully coated in the lustre dust. Set aside on kitchen paper.",
   "When the cake is chilled and set, stir the 300g reserved buttercream with a spoon to soften and remove any air bubbles. Spoon into a piping bag fitted with a large star nozzle, then pipe a thick, swirled border around the top of the cake (this doesn’t need to be exact), then scatter the remaining few sprinkles all over the top of the cake and nestle the shimmering truffles in amongst the piped rosettes. Will keep in the fridge for three days."

Using the same beaters (no need to wash) whisk the cream with the pistachio paste to soft peaks. Fold the cream and egg yolks through the meringue, spoon into a container and freeze for six hours, or overnight.",
   "To make the soufflés, brush the inside of six ramekins (about 300ml, if they’re smaller, use more) with melted butter, then coat with caster sugar. The easiest way to do this is to tip some sugar into one dish and rotate the dish so a layer sticks to the butter, then tip the excess into the next dish and so on, adding more sugar if you need to.",
   "Whisk the egg yolks with 2 tbsp sugar, the flours and a pinch of salt. Heat the milk with the pistachio paste until just steaming then, whisking constantly, pour the liquid onto the egg yolk mixture. Clean out the milk pan, then pour the mixture back in, return to the heat and cook for 2-3 mins until it’s the consistency of thick custard. Remove from the heat and cover the surface with cling film until needed. This can be done in the morning – keep this and the egg whites in a bowl, covered in the fridge.",
   "When ready to eat, heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and put a baking sheet on the top shelf to heat up. Using electric beaters, whisk the egg whites to medium-stiff peaks, then whisk in the remaining sugar. Mix a large spoonful of the egg whites into the pistachio mixture, then carefully fold in the rest. Divide between the ramekins, then run a cutlery knife around the top edge of each of the ramekin (this encourages the soufflé to rise evenly). Transfer to the hot baking sheet and cook for 8-12 mins until well risen. Serve straight away (or they will collapse) topped with the pistachio ice cream."

Spoon the ganache over the top edge of the cake, encouraging it to drizzle down the side with your spoon – start at the back of the cake to get the hang of it. Fill in the middle of the top of the cake with chocolate too. Leave to set for 10 mins.",

Slowly pour this over the cream mixture, stirring continuously, then return the pan to a low-medium heat. Cook for 5 mins, stirring, until thickened – it should coat the back of a spoon and leave a channel when you run a finger through it. Transfer to a bowl and cover the surface with baking parchment to prevent a skin forming. Chill for at least 1 hr, until thick enough to spread.",
   "Pit and halve the cherries (leaving a few whole, if you like). Toss with the icing sugar and a dash of cherry liqueur or more vanilla extract, then leave to macerate for at least 30 mins. Spoon the cherry jam or compote over the centre of the pavlova, and spread it out to the edges. Beat the chilled custard briefly, then spread it over the jam. Top with the macerated cherries and scatter over the toasted flaked almonds. Best served straightaway but leftovers will keep in the fridge for two days."

   "Just before serving, place the marquise in the freezer for 10 mins to make it easier to slice. Place the tin, bottomside up, on a serving plate, slide off the tin, then peel away the cling film. If you have a blowtorch, quickly run the flame over the surface of the marquise to give it a glossy sheen. Alternatively, dip a palette knife in boiling water and smooth the surface that way. Use a serrated knife dipped in boiling water to cut the marquise into slices."

   "To make the poached pears, put the sugar in a big saucepan with the lemon peel, cardamom pods, nutmeg, cinnamon and 1 litre water. Bring to a gentle simmer. Lower the pear halves into the liquid and place a circle of baking parchment on top, so they cook through properly. Leave over a medium heat, so that a few bubbles break the surface every now and then, and cook for 15 mins. Allow to cool in the liquid. Can be chilled overnight if making ahead.",
   "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Dust the work surface with a little plain flour. Roll out the pastry so it’s big enough to line a 20-23cm frying pan, pie dish or shallow baking tin. Grate a little nutmeg over the surface, then gently roll again to help it stick. Lift over your dish, press into the corners, then trim the edges. You can give it a pretty crimped edge, if you like, then wrap the off-cuts in cling film and keep in the fridge until needed. Scrunch up a sheet of baking parchment, unfold, and lay it over the pastry. Fill with baking beans and bake for 15 mins. Remove the beans and parchment, brush with some of the beaten egg and return to the oven for another 5 mins.",
   "Meanwhile, make the filling. Cook the remaining pears and sugar in a small pan until the pears are soft enough to squash with the back of a spoon. Drain off 3 tbsp of the poaching liquid and mix this with the cornflour, then pour back into the pears and continue cooking and squashing for another minute or so, until the filling has thickened.",
   "Sprinkle the ground almonds over the pastry case, then add the squashed pear mixture and scatter over the berries. Remove the poached pears from their liquid and blot them on some kitchen paper. Arrange them face-up among the pear mixture and berries. Using a mini pastry cutter, cut little shapes from the leftover pastry, then arrange them on top. Brush the pastry pieces with beaten egg and sprinkle with the demerara sugar. Bake for 45-50 mins until the pastry is golden and berry juice is bubbling. Cool for 10-15 mins before serving with custard, cream or ice cream, if you like."

  "Method": [
   "Start by cooking the pumpkin or squash. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Put the pumpkin in a large, deep roasting tin. Add a splash of water, no more than a few tbsps, then cover with foil. Make a small steam hole in the middle, put in the oven and cook for 45 mins or until very tender. While the pumpkin cooks, tip the seeds for the crust onto a baking tray and put in the oven on a lower shelf for 10 mins until toasted and starting to pop, then cool. Once cooked, tip the pumpkin into a sieve, drain and cool completely.",
   "Meanwhile, prepare the crust. Tip the toasted seeds and biscuits into a food processor and blitz to fine crumbs. Add the stem ginger and melted butter, and blitz again until the mixture is like wet sand. Tip into a 23cm fluted, loose- bottomed tart tin or a pie tin. Use the back of a spoon to spread the mixture evenly over the base and up the sides of the tin, pressing it firmly into place. Make sure there are no holes, so the filling can’t escape. Put in the fridge and chill for 30 mins. Clean the food processor.",
   "Turn oven down to 160C/140C fan/ gas 3. When the pumpkin is cool and any excess liquid has drained away, tip into the food processor. Add the remaining ingredients for the filling and blend until smooth. Put the chilled crust on a baking tray in the middle of the oven. Pull out the shelf and carefully fill with the pumpkin mixture, pouring it right to the top. Close the oven and bake for 40 mins – the filling should be set but still have a wobble. Cool in the tin to room temperature, then chill for at least 1 hr.",
   "For the brittle, put the pumpkin seeds in a large heavy-based frying pan and toast for a few mins until golden and starting to pop. While they toast, line a baking sheet with baking parchment. Tip the seeds into a bowl and set aside, then wipe out the pan. Tip the sugar into the pan and set over a medium heat. To turn the sugar into caramel, heat until the sugar dissolves, but don’t stir at any stage or it may crystallise – instead, swirl the pan every 10 secs or so. Increase the heat and bubble the liquid sugar until it reaches a deep caramel colour. Quickly add the seeds, swirl to incorporate, then tip out onto your lined tray. Leave to cool and set for 30 mins.",
   "Just before you’re ready to serve, prepare the cream. Pour the cream and syrup into a large bowl, and whisk until softly whipped and billowy. Remove the pie from the fridge and from its case, and place on a pretty plate or cake stand, or serve straight from the tin. Pile the cream onto the centre of the pie and swirl towards the edges, leaving a border of pumpkin exposed around the edge. When the pumpkin caramel is set, break it into small pieces with a rolling pin and sprinkle over the top – if you have more than you need, store the remainder in a sealed container for up to 2 weeks to scatter over ice cream. Serve the pie in wedges. Leftovers will keep in the fridge for up to 3 days."

Once a dough has formed, tip in the chocolate chips and beat again until all the flour is incorporated, then add the milk and mix until combined. Turn out into a disc, wrap in cling film and leave to chill in the fridge while you make the brownie. If you’re getting ahead, leave in the fridge overnight (maturing it will make the cookie even tastier).",

Press the cookie dough into the base and up the sides of the pan, lining it like a pastry tart case. There’s no need to do this neatly, as once it bakes it will all spread and puff up slightly. Bake in the oven for 15 mins.",
   "While the cookie dough is baking, whisk the eggs and sugar together for the brownie until pale and foamy. Pour the cooled melted chocolate and butter mix over and fold together until well mixed. Finally, fold in the flour until well incorporated.",
   "Remove the cookie base from the oven. Use the back of a spatula or spoon to push it down and back up the sides. Pour over the brownie mixture and return to the oven for 30 mins.",
   "Meanwhile, roll the 150g reserved cookie dough into cherry-tomato-sized balls. You should get about 24. Place, finger-width apart, on one or more large baking sheets lined with baking parchment. In the final 10 mins of the pie baking, bake the cookie balls for 5-8 mins or until golden and cooked through. Set aside to cool.",
   "Remove the pie from the oven and leave to cool in the pan for a few mins before serving. The middle should have a molten, slightly runny centre and the edges should be chewy and crispy. Pile balls of vanilla ice cream in the middle of the pie and top with the mini cookies and a dusting of cocoa powder. Take to the table and dig in."

Keep the pieces you’re not using covered and, one at a time, roll out one piece until it’s about 4mm thick. Cut out circles using a 7cm cutter. Save all the off-cuts in case you need to re-roll them. You’ll need 30-36 circles.",
   "Lay a piece of marzipan on each circle of dough and add a small spoonful of cherry mixture. Fold the circles in half, then bring the two points together like a fortune cookie. Arrange them in the tin, around the edges with the points facing in. Make a second, smaller circle, then, finally, fill the centre. Cover with buttered cling film and leave for 1 hr.",

Mix the sour cream with 150ml water and pour this in too, whisking to incorporate until you have a smooth batter the consistency of double cream – add a splash more water or milk if needed. Leave to rest for 30 mins.",
   "For the sauce, whisk the cornflour with the orange juice until smooth. Warm it in a pan, stirring to thicken, for around 2 mins. Add the marmalade, amaretto and lemon juice and cook for a few mins more. Gradually add the butter, whisking until you have a glossy sauce.",
   "Stir the melted butter into the batter, then grease a non-stick pan and place over a high heat. Stir the batter, then ladle some into the pan. Swirl it around the pan and cook until it slips away from the pan when you shake it (a couple of mins). Use a spatula to flip the pancake and cook the other side until it comes away and is golden and caramelised in patches. Remove to a plate and keep warm, either covered in foil or in a low oven. Repeat with the rest of the batter until you have a pile of pancakes. Dust each one with a little caster sugar and top with the marmalade amaretto sauce. Fold into four, top with a bit more sauce, scatter over the toasted almonds and serve."

   "Sieve the flour and cocoa into a bowl. Put the butter in a saucepan and add 225ml water. Bring to a fast boil, then simmer until the butter has melted. Tip in the flour mixture and quickly beat with a wooden spoon until the mixture comes together to a smooth, shiny dough, and pulls away from the sides of the pan. Tip the dough into a bowl and spread it up the sides with your spoon to help it to cool down quickly (but don’t let it cool completely – it’s easier to incorporate the eggs while it’s still warm). Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6 and line 2 baking sheets with baking parchment.",
   "While the dough is still warm, add the eggs a little at a time, beating well with a wooden spoon between each addition. You’re looking for a smooth consistency, that reluctantly falls off the spoon in a V shape (you may not need to use all the egg). If the mixture becomes too runny, you won’t be able to pipe it; if it’s too thick, it won’t puff up in the oven. When you’re happy with the consistency, spoon it into a disposable piping bag.",
   "Snip off the end of the piping bag to give you a 1cm opening. Holding the bag at a 90-degree angle to the baking tray, pipe balls of the dough, about the size of a walnut, over the 2 sheets – you should make 18-20 in total. Dip your finger in a little water and gently pat down any peaks on the top of the balls of dough. Place the 2 sheets in the oven and bake for 25-30 mins, swapping the trays over after 20 mins. The choux buns should be puffed up and crisp when cooked. Leave to cool completely.",
   "Spoon the caramel into a large bowl, add 1/2 tsp salt, mix well and taste – add a little more salt if you like. Add the cream and whisk until holding soft peaks (the cream can now be stored in the fridge for up to 1 day).",
   "Split the choux buns in half, spoon a generous dollop of salted caramel cream into each and replace the lids. Melt the white and dark chocolates in 2 bowls suspended over pans of gently simmering water, or in the microwave. Transfer the dark chocolate to a piping bag and set aside to cool a little. Top each bun with a spoonful of white chocolate, stack the profiteroles on a plate or cake stand, then drizzle over the dark chocolate and sprinkle with chocolate sprinkles or edible glitter, if you like. Serve straight away."

   "Crack open 10 of the cardamom pods with a pestle and mortar, and tip into a saucepan. Add the milk and warm until steaming but not boiling. Add 50g butter (leave the remaining butter at room temperature to soften) and set aside to cool until lukewarm, swirling the pan from time to time to encourage the butter to melt.",
   "Put the flour, 75g of the sugar, the yeast, cinnamon and 1 /2 tsp salt into a large bowl, or the bowl of a freestanding mixer. Mix until well combined. When the milk has cooled, strain it through a sieve into the flour, discarding the cardamom. Using a wooden spoon or dough hook, mix to form a soft dough. Tip onto a work surface and knead for 10 mins, or run the freestanding mixer for 5 mins, until the dough is smooth and stretchy. Clean the bowl, lightly grease with oil, then return the dough to the bowl and turn it over until well coated in oil. Cover the bowl with a tea towel or cling film and leave to rise for 2 hrs or until doubled in size (you could prove it in the fridge overnight).",
   "Crack the remaining cardamom pods using a pestle and mortar. Prise them open and tip the seeds back into the mortar, discarding the pods. Crush the seeds to a powder, then combine with 150g sugar. In a bowl, mix the remaining butter with all but 2 tbsp of the cardamom sugar.",
   "Line two baking trays with parchment. Punch the dough down to knock out the air, then roll to a rectangle roughly 35 x 45cm, with the longer edge facing you. Spread the cardamom butter over the surface, right to the edges. Fold the top third down to the middle and the bottom third up, like an envelope, so you have three layers of dough. Score, then cut into 12 equal strips, measuring about 3.5 x 11cm each. Cut each strip down the centre, leaving it attached at the top. Twist each strip away from the centre two or three times, then tie the dough in a knot and tuck the ends underneath the bun. Put each on the tray when done.",
   "Cover both trays with a sheet of lightly oiled cling film and leave somewhere warm to rise for 30 mins - 1 hr, or until almost doubled in size. Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5.",
   "Uncover the buns and brush all over with the beaten egg, then sprinkle with the pearl sugar. Bake for 20-25 mins until golden brown – swap the trays halfway through if they’re browning unevenly.",
   "Tip the remaining cardamom sugar into a pan and add 50ml water. Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat and set aside to cool, swirling to dissolve the sugar. Brush the syrup over the buns two or three times as they cool, leave them to soak for 20 mins before eating. Will keep for 2 days in a sealed container, or freeze for 2 months. Defrost at room temperature and reheat for 5 mins in the oven before eating."

Spread half the chocolate ganache all over the pudding and, as quickly as you can, stick the remaining Maltesers all over the surface – this is easiest if you start around the bottom and work your way up in layers. The chocolate ganache will start to set, so use a little more from the bowl to make the Maltesers stick. Once covered, return to the freezer for at least a further 4 hrs (or for up to 3 days), removing it 10 mins before serving. Top with a dusting of icing sugar and a sprig of holly, if you like."

When the cream mixture is hot and steaming, pour a splash into the cocoa paste to loosen it, then tip this back into the cream mixture. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring continuously until the custard is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon – you should be able to draw a line through the custard on the back of the spoon using your fingertip. Remove from the heat and sieve the custard into a jug to remove any lumps. Cover the surface with a circle of baking parchment to prevent a skin forming.

Check if the blondies are cooked by giving the tin a gentle shake, they should be mostly set but a little bit of a wobble in the centre is fine. Cool completely in the tin – the blondies will sink in the middle as they cool, just like brownies. If you try to remove the blondies too soon, they will be too soft to cut, so be patient. Once cool, cut into 16 squares. The blondies will keep for 5 days in a sealed container."

Beat the eggs and sugar together in a separate bowl using an electric whisk for 4-5 mins until pale and fluffy. Remove the chocolate mix from the heat and gently fold in the whipped egg mix to combine. Fill each mould just a third of the way up with the fondant mixture, then drop a ball of filling onto the middle of each. Spoon over enough of the remaining fondant mixture to come two-thirds of the way up the sides of the moulds – you need to leave the final third free to allow for rising. Freeze for at least 4 hrs.

Beat the egg with the vanilla, then add to the bowl. Mix briefly with a cutlery knife to combine, then use your hands to knead the dough together – try not to overwork the dough, or the biscuits will be tough. Shape into a disc, then wrap in cling film and chill for at least 15 mins. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line two baking sheets with baking parchment.",
   "Dust a work surface with flour. Halve the dough, then roll one half out to the thickness of a £1 coin. Use an egg-shaped cookie cutter (ours was 10cm long; you could also make a cardboard template to cut around) to stamp out as many cookies as you can, then transfer them to one of the baking sheets, leaving a little space between the biscuits. Repeat with the other half of the dough. If you want to make jammy biscuits, use a small circular cutter to stamp holes in half of the biscuits (where the yolk would be). If you intend to make both iced and jammy biscuits, only stamp holes in a quarter of the biscuits.",
   "Bake for 12-15 mins, until the biscuits are pale gold. Cool on the sheets for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool fully. Once cool, decorate to your liking (see next steps). Will keep in an airtight container for up to five days.",
   "To decorate the biscuits with icing, add enough water to the icing sugar to make a thick icing – it should hold its shape without spreading when piped. Transfer about a third of the icing to a piping bag fitted with a very small round nozzle (or just snip a tiny opening at the tip). Pipe an outline around the biscuits, then draw patterns in the middle – lines, spots and zigzags work well. Leave to dry for 10 mins. Divide the remaining icing between as many colours as you’d like to use, then use the gels to dye them. Loosen each icing with a few drops of water, then transfer them to piping bags. Use the coloured icing to fill the empty spaces on the biscuits. You may need to use a cocktail stick to tease it into the corners. Once covered, leave to dry for a few hours.",
   "To make the jammy middle biscuits, dust the biscuits with holes in the middle with a heavy coating of icing sugar. Spread the jam or curd generously over the whole biscuits, then sandwich the dusted biscuits on top of them."

Pour 50ml of the hot cream over the white chocolate (strain it if the orange zest is in big strands), and the remaining cream over the dark and milk mixture. Leave the bowls for 1-2 mins, then stir until smooth and glossy. Set aside to cool for 10 mins.",

   "When the cakes are cold, you can start assembling. With the cakes flat-side up, use a 7cm biscuit cutter to mark a circle in the centre of each. Use a spoon to gently scoop a dip in each cake, about 4cm deep (save the crumbs for cake truffles – see tip, left.) Remove the cream cheese mixture from the fridge and use to fill the cavities in the cakes, spreading a little onto the flat surfaces too, to help them stick together. Invert 1 cake onto the other to create a sphere, and place on a wire rack set over a baking tray (this will catch any chocolate drips).",
   "To ice the cake, the chocolate ganache needs to be the right consistency – pourable but not too runny. If it has set a little too much, place in the microwave for 10-20 secs, then mix until smooth; if it is too runny, chill until it has firmed up a little. Pour half the ganache over the cake, letting it cover the sides and run into the tray below (use the chocolate drips for cake truffles, see Tip). Cover the whole surface using a palette knife. This is just the first coating, so won’t fill the gap between the sponges. Chill the cake for 20 mins or until the ganache has firmed up a little.",
   "Remove the cake from the fridge. Cover the gap around the middle with the remaining ganache, smoothing it all over with a palette knife. Return to the fridge for another 20 mins until firm, then transfer to a serving plate.",
   "Melt the remaining white chocolate in the microwave in short 10-sec bursts. Drizzle over the top of the cake, then scatter with dried cranberries, sprinkles and edible glitter, if you like. Chill if not serving straight away – it will keep in the fridge for up to 2 days. Remove from the fridge 30 mins before serving."

Add the cocoa to one lot, a dot of pink colour to another, and leave the last one plain (add a little more icing sugar if you need to). Spoon each into a piping bag or a sandwich bag with the corner snipped off.",

   "For the caramelised breadcrumbs"
  ],
  "Method": [
   "To make the caramelised breadcrumbs, heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Tear half the bread into little pieces (it’s better doing this by hand than in a food processor. The largestpiece should be no bigger than a petit pois). Whizz the rest in a food processor into coarse crumbs. It’s best to have a mixture of textures.",
   "In a frying pan, heat the butter until it melts, then continue to cook until it starts to brown a little. Remove from the heat and stir in the bread and sugar. Spread out on a baking sheet (it’s important that the mixture is not in clumps) and cook for 20 mins, tossing a few times during baking, until toasted. Leave to cool.",
   "Heat the cream with 100g sugar and a pinch of salt in a heavy-bottomed saucepan until it comes to just under the boil. Take off the heat. Leave to sit for about 5 mins. Beat the egg yolks in a bowl with the remaining sugar and pour in the cream, stirring continuously. Wash out the saucepan, then pour the cream mixture into it.",
   "Set over a low heat and cook, stirring, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. It will take about 8-10 mins. Make sure the custard doesn’t boil or it will curdle. As soon as it’s thick enough, transfer to a cold bowl and stir in the buttermilk. Keep stirring the mixture at intervals as it cools. Cover the custard and put in the fridge to chill.",
   "Churn the custard in an ice cream machine following the manufacturer’s instructions, adding the breadcrumbs when the ice cream is almost frozen. Transfer to a container, cover with cling film and keep in the freezer. If you don’t have an ice cream machine, pour the mixture into a shallow container and put in the freezer. Remove from the freezer every couple of hours and beat vigorously to break up the ice crystals, adding the breadcrumbs when the ice cream is almost frozen. You want to end up with a smooth, creamy mixture."

Roll each ball out to the thickness of a £1 coin and use the downloadable template to cut out the train parts A-D. You will need two A pieces, one B piece, two C pieces and three D pieces, plus 10 small wheels (about 2cm in diameter) and two larger wheels (about 4cm in diameter). Use biscuit cutters or the wide end of a piping nozzle to stamp out the wheels. Use what remains for gingerbread stars or people, if you like. Transfer all the pieces to the prepared trays.",

   "For the decorations, mix the icing sugar with just enough water to make a thick icing the consistency of melted chocolate. Spoon into a piping bag and snip off the end, then draw windows on the A pieces, spokes on the wheel pieces and any other decorations you like, adding the sprinkles and balls while the icing is still wet.",
   "To assemble the driver’s carriage, use the icing to glue the two A pieces to the B piece (for the taller back of the carriage), then glue one of the D pieces to the front. For the second carriage glue the two C pieces together with two D pieces. Use cans to support the sides while the icing sets, if needed (at least 30 mins). Glue three small wheels to both sides of the second carriage. Glue one large wheel at the back of the driver’s carriage, on both sides, then two small ones beside those. Leave to set for another 30 mins.",
   "Use any leftover icing to decorate the train, sticking sprinkles and silver balls to its sides. Leave to set for a final 30 mins, then fill the carriages with the wrapped sweets. The assembled train will keep in an airtight cake tin or on display (covered overnight to protect from dust) for up to four weeks."

   "First, make the pastry. Sift the flour into a bowl and stir in the sugar and a pinch of salt. Add the butter and rub it in with your fingertips until you have a coarse crumb consistency. Stir in 2-3 tbsp of ice-cold water and bring the mixture together with your hands. Knead it against the side of the bowl, and if it comes together smoothly, squash it into a ball. If it’s still crumbling, add a little more iced water and work it until you have a pliable pastry dough. Wrap it in baking parchment and chill for 30 mins. Meanwhile, macerate the cherries in the sugar and lemon juice in a bowl.",
   "To make the frangipane, blitz the almonds in a food processor until finely chopped, then add the butter, flour, vanilla extract and sugar, and blitz until combined. Add the egg, and blitz again to make a paste.",
   "Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry into a large circle about 30cm wide, and the thickness of a pound coin. It doesn’t matter if the edges are split. Slide onto a baking sheet lined with baking parchment, and spread over the conserve, leaving about a 4cm border all the way around the edge. Cover this with the frangipane, then press half the cherries into it. Fold over the pastry edges to encase the edges of the cherries, pressing down the creases so it holds together. Brush with the beaten egg and scatter some granulated sugar over the cherries and pastry. Put in the freezer for 10 mins.",
   "Bake the galette for 45 mins, then remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10-15 mins. Pour over the remaining fresh cherries and spoon over any juices. Serve with clotted cream, if you like."

Place the tin on the tray on the middle shelf and bake for 40-45 mins, until the pastry is deep golden brown and the filling is bubbling.

   "Stir the egg and vanilla into the chocolate mixture. Put the flour in a large mixing bowl, then add the chocolate mixture and stir until smooth. Divide the mixture evenly between the paper cases; they should be about three-quarters full. Bake on a low shelf in the oven for 20-22 mins. Press on the cupcakes to check if they’re cooked; the tops should spring back. Remove from the oven and leave to cool.",
   "Use the image above as a guide to decorating the cupcakes. Packet fondant can often be quite sticky; if yours is, pat walnut-sized lumps of fondant over the surface of each cake, rather than trying to roll it all out. Knead yellow and red fondant together to make orange icing. Make extra decorations, like hair and mouths, out of fondant and stick them on using a little water. Use the icing pens to draw lines in the fondant. Add icing eyes wherever you like."

   "To make the dumplings, heat the milk to lukewarm. Be careful not to go any hotter or you risk destroying the yeast. Stir in 1 teaspoon of the sugar and the dried yeast and leave in a warm place for 10 minutes until bubbles begin to appear on the surface.",
   "In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, the remaining sugar, egg, melted butter and the yeast mixture. Stir together with a wooden spoon at first, then using your hands once the dough starts to come together in a ball. Tip out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for about 5 minutes until the dough is smooth and springy.",
   "Put the dough in a greased bowl, cover with cling film, and leave to rise somewhere warm for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.",
   "While the dough is proving, make the vanilla sauce. Put the milk and vanilla seeds in a saucepan and warm gently. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar. Pour the warm milk onto the egg yolk mixture, whisk everything together, then return the mixture to the pan and heat very gently, stirring all the time, until the mixture thickens. This might take up to 20 minutes over a low heat, so to speed things up, you could slake 2 teaspoons of cornflour with a splash of water, stir together, then add it to the sauce. Keep cooking until it has thickened to your liking.",
   "When the dough has almost finished proving, prepare the poaching liquid. Put the milk, sugar and butter in a large saucepan or deep sided frying pan, with a tight-fitting lid and heat until the butter has melted and the sugar is dissolved.",
   "Divide the dough into 8 equal portions and shape each portion into a ball, being careful to tuck the seams in underneath so you have a smooth top to each ball. Pop the dumplings into the poaching liquid, making sure they are all sitting on the base of the pan with a little space in between each dumpling, and put the lid on and don't remove it for the first 25 minutes of cooking time. Keep the heat low under the pan so the dumplings are poaching. After 25 minutes, check the tops of the dumplings feel firm to the touch, cook for a little longer if you need to, then remove the lid and cook for a further 5 minutes or until any remaining liquid has evaporated so that the dumplings develop their characteristic golden bases. Pour the vanilla sauce over the dumplings to serve."

Roast for 15-20 mins, or until the rhubarb has softened but is still holding its shape and a vibrant pink syrup has formed. Remove from the oven, discard the vanilla pod and allow to cool.",
   "Remove the custard from the fridge, beat to loosen, then pour over the pastry and smooth with a spatula. Top with the roasted rhubarb, brushing a little of the syrup on top, then sprinkle over the pistachios. Best eaten on the day its made."

When the thermometer reaches 100C, beat the whites with an electric whisk until stiff peaks form. Keep boiling the sugar syrup until it reaches soft-ball stage – 113C on the thermometer.

On a medium speed, slowly add the eggs, then increase the speed and gradually beat in the butter, waiting for one bit to be fully incorporated before adding more. The texture of the finished dough will be very wet, similar to brioche. Cover the bowl with cling film and prove overnight in the fridge – this will make the dough easier to handle.",

Remove the pears from the heat and leave to cool in the syrup, then refrigerate until needed.",

Put each one into a buttered dariole mould, cover with buttered cling film and prove in a warm place for 1 -1 1/2 hrs until the dough has doubled in size.

Remove the puddings from the oven and cool for 5 mins, then remove from the moulds and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.",

   "Mix the flours, spices, baking powder and 1 tsp salt in a bowl. In a stand mixer, vigorously whisk the eggs and sugars for 3 mins until thick and frothy. Slowly pour in the oil in a steady stream. Turn the speed down, then add the flour mixture, 2 tbsp at a time, alternating with the yogurt, until incorporated. Mix in the grated pear (for no longer than 20 secs). Divide the mixture between the tins and bake for 25-30 mins or until a skewer inserted comes out dry.",
   "For the caramel, heat the pear juice and perry in a pan until reduced to about 50ml. Add the sugar and butter and whisk to a smooth caramel, then add the cream and whisk again until smooth. Add sea salt to your taste – I’d go for a generous pinch, so that the caramel is still fruity and sharp but has a little saltiness to it – then allow to cool slightly to just warmer than room temperature.",
   "To make the buttercream, put the egg whites and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Place the bowl over a pan of boiling water, then whisk until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is no longer gritty. Put the bowl in the mixer, then whisk until soft peaks form and the bowl returns to room temperature. Switch to the paddle attachment, then add the butter, one spoonful at a time. Add the tahini, vanilla and a pinch of salt, and beat to a light, fluffy icing.",
   "Place the bottom layer of sponge on a platter or cake stand, then top with a layer of the buttercream and scatter over a third of the chopped pear. Repeat with the next two layers. To ice the cake, do an intial layer all over, chill in the fridge for 20 mins, then use the remaining icing to cover everything. Use a stepped spatula to spread it out evenly. Pour the caramel over the top of the cake, and allow it to drip down the sides. Scatter with toasted buckwheat, dehydrated pear and rosemary, if you like."

   "MAKE THE CAKE\u2028 Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Oil and line the base and sides of three 20cm cake tins with baking parchment – if your cake tins are quite shallow, line the sides to a depth of at least 5cm.",
   "Mix the flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, sugar, mixed spice and salt in a bowl. ",
   "Whisk the buttermilk, oil, vanilla extract and 75ml water with the eggs until smooth. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and whisk until well combined. Scoop about a third of the cake mixture into a tin. If using, mix the food colouring into the remaining batter and divide this between the other tins. Bake for 25-30 mins, or until the cakes have risen and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. ",
   "Cool in the tins for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack, peel off the parchment and cool. The sponges will keep, wrapped tightly in cling film, for three days, or wrap and freeze for up to two months. ",
   "NOW MAKE THE ICING\u2028 Beat the butter with half the icing sugar and vanilla until smooth. Add the remaining icing sugar and the cream cheese, and beat again until combined – don’t overmix or the icing may become runny. ",
   "NEXT, ASSEMBLE THE CAKE\u2028 Put one of the red sponges on a cake stand or cake board, sticking it down with a small blob of icing. Sandwich with the gold sponge, being generous with the icing. Top with more icing and the final red sponge, flat-side up. When assembled, use a palette knife to cover the entire cake with a thin layer of the icing, filling any gaps between sponges, but don’t worry about completely covering the sponges at this stage. This is called a crumb coat and ensures that your final layer is crumb-free. Make space in the fridge and chill for 30 mins to allow the icing to firm up. ",
   "MAKE THE CHOCOLATE TREES Melt the white chocolate in the microwave, or in a small bowl over a pan of simmering water. Stir in a spot of green food colouring gel if you want to make them green. Transfer to a piping bag and leave to firm up for a few mins (this will make the trees thicker). Line a baking sheet with parchment. ",
   "Snip off the end of the piping bag and quickly pipe the chocolate backwards and forwards in thin lines to create little Christmas trees (ours were 7-10cm tall). ",
   "Decorate with sprinkles and chill until you’re ready to decorate the cake. ",
   "ICE THE CAKE\u2028 Once the crumb coat is chilled, use the remaining icing to completely cover the cake. This is easiest if you pile the icing on top of the cake, then use a palette knife to ease it over the edge and down the sides. You can make it as smooth or as rough as you like. Chill for another 30 mins.",
   "Meanwhile, for the chocolate drip, melt the white chocolate in a bowl set over a pan of lightly simmering water or in the microwave in short bursts. Pour into a disposable piping bag and set aside to firm up a little – you want it to be pourable but not too runny.",
   "Remove the cake from the fridge. If you like, you can use an edible gold spray to cover the surface in a thin layer of shimmer. When the white chocolate is the correct consistency, snip off the end of the piping bag and pipe drizzles down the side of the cake. Fill in the top with the remaining chocolate. Push them into the white chocolate topping before it sets. "

Set half of the icing aside in a bowl. Divide the other half of the icing between three bowls and colour each a different shade of blue, a dark, medium and light. Stack the sponges, spreading most of the white icing over each one using a palette knife, then use the palette knife to roughly coat the outside of the cakes with the remaining white icing to create a crumb coat. Chill for 30 mins. ",
   "Put each of the blue icing shades in separate piping bags and cut a large 2cm hole at the bottom. Starting with the dark shade at the bottom of the cake, pipe an even ring onto the whole cake, two-three times around. Continue working your way up the cake with the icing getting lighter as you reach the top of the cake. Using a small palette knife, work your way around the join in between each row, gently pushing to join each line together. Save some icing in the piping bags to decorate the top. Smooth over the cake with a large palette knife or cake scraper to create a smooth ombre icing, keeping the excess to decorate the top. ",
   "You can either mix all the leftover icing together and put in a clean piping bag with a star nozzle to get a multicoloured effect, or pipe individual shades on the top. Add a few dots around the top of the cake in the varying blue colours to look like waves (using some of the white to look like the top of a crashing wave), and dot around the pearls, sprinkles, shells and mermaid tails, pushing them into the icing on the side of the cake, and on top to finish."

Chill them in the fridge on the tray while you prepare the topping.",

Leave 1cm pastry overhanging (save some of the pastry scraps for later). Line with baking parchment (scrunch it up first to make it more pliable) and fill with baking beans. Blind-bake for 15-20 mins until the sides are set, then remove the parchment and beans and return to the oven for 5 mins until golden brown. Trim the pastry so it’s flush with the top of the tin – a small serrated knife is best for this. If there are any cracks, patch them up with the pastry scraps.",
   "Meanwhile, weigh the butter, syrup and sugars into a pan, and add 1 /4 tsp salt. Heat until the butter has melted and the sugar dissolved, stirring until smooth. Remove from the heat and cool for 10 mins. Reduce oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3.",
   "Beat the eggs in a bowl. Add the syrup mixture, vanilla and pecans, and mix until well combined. Pour half the mixture into the tart case, scatter over half the chocolate chips, then cover with the remaining filling and chocolate chips. Bake on the middle shelf for 50-55 mins until set.

   "Tip the flour into a bowl with the icing sugar and a good pinch of salt. Add the butter and rub in using your fingers until they resemble fine breadcrumbs. Mix the egg yolk with 1 tbsp cold water, drizzle over the flour and butter, then mix and knead briefly. Shape into a disc, wrap in cling film and chill for 30 mins.",
   "On a floured surface, roll out the pastry until big enough to line a deep 20cm cake or tart tin, preferably one with a removable base. Drape the pastry over the tin and press it into the corners, trim the excess with some scissors but leave a 1cm overhang as the pastry will shrink while cooking. Line with a piece of scrunched-up baking parchment (to make it more pliable) and fill with baking beans or rice. Chill the tart case for 10 mins while you heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.",
   "Bake the pastry case for 20 mins. Remove the parchment and beans and return to the oven for another 5 mins, or until biscuit brown. Leave to cool. Now make the filling. Put the grapefruit, lemon zest and juice and the juniper berries in a pan and warm through for a few mins to help infuse the juniper flavour. In a bowl, whisk the egg, sugar and cornflour until creamy. Add the gin and mix again.",
   "Strain the warm juice over the egg mixture, mix, then strain back into the saucepan. Set over a low heat, stirring continuously with a spatula until the mixture thickens enough to part for a second or two when stirred. Make sure you get into the corners of the pan so none of the mixture overheats and splits. Remove from the heat and mix in the butter until it has melted and the curd is smooth. Pour into the tart case, then chill for at least 3 hrs.",
   "To make the meringue, put the egg whites, sugar, 1 tbsp water and a good pinch of salt in a large heatproof bowl. Place over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bowl doesn’t touch the hot water and whisk until thick – this should take about 5 mins. Remove from the heat and continue whisking for 3 mins until cooled slightly and really stiff.",
   "Remove the tart from the tin. Pile the meringue on top, swirling it to create peaks and troughs. Serve as it is or use a blowtorch or grill to scorch the tips of the meringue, if you like. Leftovers will keep for up to three days."

Put the white chocolate in a bowl, pour over the sugar mix in the pan and leave for 1 min to melt. Whisk everything together, then divide into three bowls.",
   "Using the gel colourings, colour each bowl a different shade. Put one of the colours that you would like to use as an accent colour on top to one side. Stir all of the colours occasionally leaving them to sit until they reach 30-32C so they are thick enough to glaze the cake without being too thin and running off the edges. Once at that temperature, pour the remaining two colours on top of each other and stir slightly to marble them together.",
   "Place your chilled iced cake onto a cooling rack set in a deep tray (to collect the excess glaze). Pour over the mirror glaze which should be at 30-32C, allowing it to drip down the sides. Drizzle over the accent colour you’ve saved then, using a paint brush, flick over some gold lustre, if using. Leave it to set completely before slicing and serving. Will keep, in the fridge, for up to three days. "

Meanwhile, whip the cream until billowy and just holding its shape, but not stiff. Put the lemon curd in a pan with the lemon juice, stir until smooth then bring to the boil. Take off the heat and leave to cool for 1 min then squeeze the excess water from the gelatine and add to the curd mixture, stir until the gelatine has dissolved then pour into the whipped cream. Beat until the mixture is smooth then pour it into your prepared hemisphere mould. Chill in the fridge for 1 hr or until set.",
   "While the mousse is setting make the sponge base. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line a swiss roll tin with baking parchment and grease well with butter. Whisk the eggs and sugar together with an electric hand whisk for 2-3 mins or until thickened and pale.",
   "Fold the flour, baking powder and lemon zest into the egg mixture with a large metal spoon until there are no pockets of flour visible. Gently tip the mixture into your prepared Swiss roll tin and bake in the oven for 15 mins or until lightly golden and springy to the touch. Allow to cool then cut a circle out of the sponge mixture which is big enough to fit snugly into your hemisphere tin on top of the mousse.",
   "When the sponge is completely cold, spread it with the lemon curd and sit in on top of the set mousse (curd side down) and press down very gently so it sticks. Carefully turn the mousse cake out of the mould so that the mousse is now at the top, and sit it on a wire rack on top of a baking tray. Put the mousse cake in the freezer while you make the mirror glaze.",
   "To make the mirror glaze soak the gelatine leaves in cold water while you heat up the curd and lemon juice in a small pan. Add the strip of lemon zest and bring to the boil. Take it off the heat and allow to cool for 1 min then remove the lemon zest, and add the gelatine as before, squeezing out the excess water first. Pour the glaze through a sieve into a jug and stir occasionally as it cools. When it has cooled down and is starting to thicken, but can still be poured, take the mousse cake out of the freezer and pour all of the glaze slowly over the surface. The excess will run off into the tray below the wire rack - this is meant to happen. You can then pour it back into the jug and glaze again if you like.",
   "Softly whip the cream for the decoration, and transfer to a piping bag then pipe dots or spirals tightly a long the edge where the sponge meets the mousse cake. Cut the lemon slices in half and place them in the middle to decorate. Keep in the fridge until you want to serve it. Can be made the day before."

   "Tip the sugar and milk into a medium saucepan over low-medium heat, and whisk until the milk is steaming and the sugar has dissolved. Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks and cornflour together in a bowl to make a smooth paste.",
   "Add a few spoonfuls of the hot milk to the yolk mixture, whisking to loosen. Slowly whisk this back into the saucepan of hot milk. Continue to whisk until the mixture begins to thicken to a custard-like consistency, about 3-5 mins.",
   "Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the butter, dark chocolate and vanilla until the chocolate and butter have melted and the mixture is completely smooth. Pour this over the chilled base and smooth the surface with a spatula. Cover with a circle of baking parchment to prevent a skin forming and chill until set (about 3-4 hrs). Will keep chilled for up to 24 hrs.",
   "Just before you’re ready to serve, whip the cream, icing sugar and vanilla together to soft peaks using an electric whisk. Spoon this over the middle of the pie and gently spread to the edge using the back of the spoon. Sprinkle with chocolate shavings. Or, you could also try sprinkling with crushed candy cane pieces for a mint-chocolate flavour."

Pour in the yeast mixture, the rest of the milk (reheat if you need to, but make sure it’s not too hot), the melted butter and the egg, then mix into a dough. Tip out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-10 mins, then put in a bowl and cover with cling film. Leave for 45 mins-1 hr, or until doubled in size.",
   "Meanwhile, make the jam. Put a saucer in the freezer. Warm the sugar over a low heat in a saucepan for a few mins, being careful not to burn it. Add the blackberries and cook until they release their juice, then add the lemon juice, turn up the heat and bring to the boil, stirring gently.",
   "Skim off any surface scum and boil for about 8 mins. Spoon some jam onto the cold saucer – if it forms a skin that wrinkles when touched, it’s ready. If it isn’t ready yet, keep cooking and testing. Leave to cool slightly while you finish making the doughnuts.",

Fry the doughnuts in batches of two or three for 1 min each side until golden. Remove with a slotted spoon, drain on kitchen paper and roll immediately in sugar.",
   "Use a jam syringe or piping bag to fill the doughnuts with jam (make a little slit in the top of each doughnut with a knife first if that helps), then dust with more sugar. Serve with crème anglaise or custard. If you have any jam left over, spoon it into a sterilised jar. The jam will keep for a couple of weeks."

   "First, make the sponge. Put the egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl and whisk with an electric whisk until thick and creamy. Sift the cocoa powder over the egg mixture and whisk in thoroughly. Wash and dry the beaters. In a clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff but not dry. Fold a third of the egg whites into the cocoa mixture, then gently fold in the rest until evenly distributed.",
   "Pour into the prepared tin and spread gently with a spatula. Bake in the centre of the oven for 25 mins or until well risen and just beginning to shrink away from the sides of the tin. Remove from the oven, loosen the edges with a round-bladed knife and leave to cool in the tin.",
   "Prepare the filling while the cake is cooling. Place a large sheet of cling film on the work surface, take the ice cream out of its tub and place on top. Working quickly, cover the ice cream with cling film, then press and roll into a long sausage shape. It will need to be 33cm long and around 5cm wide. Wrap a second piece of cling film around the first and twist the ends to maintain the sausage shape. Return to the freezer to harden for at least 1 hr.",
   "Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Take the ice cream out of the freezer, unwrap it and place in the centre of the sponge. Using the parchment to help you, bring up the sides to enclose the ice cream and carefully lift the roll onto the lined baking tray, rotating it so the seal is underneath. Trim the ends. Cover the cake and tin with cling film and place in the freezer for at least 4 hrs, or up to 1 week.",
   "Make the meringue topping 20 mins before serving. Put the sugar and 175ml water in a pan and bring to a rolling boil over a high heat. Continue to boil until it reaches 115C on a sugar thermometer.",
   "Meanwhile, put the egg whites in a large mixing bowl or tabletop mixer and whisk the egg whites to soft peaks. Continue whisking at high speed and very slowly trickle in the hot sugar syrup. The meringue will begin to thicken and become glossy after about 10 mins. Continue to whisk until it is just warm, then whisk in the vanilla extract. Use the meringue immediately, as it is easier to work with while warm.",
   "Fit a large piping bag with a 1.5cm star nozzle and fill with the meringue. Take the baking tray out of the freezer and slide the log gently onto a serving platter using a couple of spatulas. Pipe the meringue in lines down the length, then around the ends. Use a cook’s blowtorch to scorch the meringue all over. Alternatively, bake for 8 mins at 220C/200C fan/gas 7 or until the meringue is set and lightly browned. Serve in generous slices (it will sit quite happily for 5-10 mins). Please note this recipe contains lightly cooked egg whites, which may be unsuitable for babies and toddlers, the elderly, pregnant women and people who already feel unwell."

Put the butter and flour in a food processor and pulse until it resembles fresh breadcrumbs.  Add the yolk of the egg and the sugar and pulse again until mixed through then, add a tbsp at a time of very cold water pulsing the processor after each addition. Stop adding water as soon as the dough starts to come together as one piece.",
   "Remove the dough from the processor and continue to bring together by kneading gently with your hands. Once you have a smooth ball of dough wrap it tightly in cling film and chill in the fridge for 30mins. ",
   "Heat oven to 190C/170C/gas 4 and grease a 23cm loose bottomed fluted tart tin. Roll out the chilled pastry on a lightly floured surface and use it to line the tin. Leave about half a cm of pastry proud of the edge of the tin - snipping it to length with kitchen scissors. ",
   "Line the base with a piece of baking parchment and weigh it down with baking beans or uncooked rice. Bake for 15 mins then remove the paper and beans and brush the pastry surface with beaten egg white. Return to the oven for a further 15-20 mins or until crisp, golden and cooked through. Leave to cool completely (can be done a day ahead). ",
   "Spread half of the caramel on the case of the pastry case and layer the sliced bananas on top. Cover with the rest of the caramel and place in the fridge.",
   "Whip the cream until billowy thick and spoon it over the top of the tart. To serve finely grate over a 1-2 pieces of dark chocolate to garnish. "

Leave to cool and re-crumble, then set aside (keep the oven on).",
   "For the apples, add the butter, sugar, apple juice, cinnamon and bay to a saucepan. Boil vigorously until you have a sputtering, buttery caramel. Remove the bay and cinnamon, then throw in half the Bramley apples. Cook down to a purée, then remove from the heat and stir through the rest of the Bramley apple chunks until coated. Transfer to a baking dish.",
   "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 (if you part-baked your topping in step 1, it should already be at this temperature). Arrange the sliced Cox’s apple over the cooked apples in an even layer. Sprinkle your choice of crumble mixture loosely and roughly over the top, then bake for 30-40 mins until the crumble has browned and the filling is bubbling at the sides (30 mins if you part-baked the crumble, but keep an eye on it). Leave to rest for 10 mins before serving. While the crumble is baking, make the optional sugar and spice blend by mixing all the ingredients with a small pinch of salt. Serve on the side to sprinkle over."

  "Method": [
   "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter 6 x 150ml capacity ramekins. Place the ginger biscuits in a food processor and blitz until chopped into very small pieces then add the sultanas and mixed peel and blitz again just once or twice to combine.",
   "Melt the butter in a pan, then mix in the cinnamon followed by the biscuit mixture. Divide equally between the ramekins, so the base of each is covered with a layer about 1cm thick. Press down a little with the back of a teaspoon then bake them on a tray in the oven for 10 mins until crisp and golden. Leave to cool, then turn oven down to 150C/130C fan /gas 2.",
   "Whisk together all the cheesecake filling ingredients until smooth. Place the ramekins on a baking tray and pour some mixture into each one, filling to about 1cm below the rim. Carefully slide them into the oven and cook for 25-30 mins until just set. The mixture should still be ever so slightly wobbly when gently tapped. Don’t worry if it dips a little or cracks. Remove from the oven and leave to cool completely before covering with cling film and putting in the fridge. You can make to this point up to 2 days ahead.",
   "To make the decoration, place the icing sugar into a large bowl and add enough orange juice to make a stiff paste. Transfer to a disposable piping bag and snip off the end. Run a small knife around the edge of the cheesecakes and turn them out onto a board so that the biscuit layer is facing upwards. Use the orange icing mixture to pipe a cross on the top of each one then use a cake slice or palette knife to place onto plates then sprinkle with the orange zest before serving."

Drizzle a little oil into the pan, then wipe it with a piece of kitchen paper – you only want a small film on the base of the pan. Make three tall pancakes by piling three spoonfuls of the batter into the pan, using about two thirds of the mixture. Keep them piled quite high, don’t tip the pan or spread them out like you would normal pancakes. Cover with a lid and cook for 2-4 mins, the steam will help them set. Remove the lid and add another dollop of batter to each pancake, this will create the classic height and thickness. Return the lid and cook for another 4-6 mins until the top feels slightly set.",
   "Very gently, and carefully, turn the pancakes over in the pan with a fish slice or spatula. The bases should be a light golden brown. Add the lid back on and cook for another 4-6 mins until both sides are golden brown and they have a slight wobble, but are not collapsing or sticky. Serve with a pat of butter, a dusting of icing sugar and a little maple syrup."

   "Whisk together 150ml of the oil, 200ml buttermilk, 2 eggs and 1 tsp vanilla in a large jug. Add the cooled milk and syrup mixture, and whisk again. Gradually whisk the wet ingredients into the dry until smooth. Divide between the tins. Bake for 25-30 mins, or until a skewer inserted into the middle of each sponge comes out clean.",
   "Leave the sponges to cool in the tins for 10 mins, then invert onto a wire rack (so the bases become the tops), peel off the parchment and leave to cool completely. Clean, oil and line the tins again as described in step 1, and repeat steps 1-3 to make two more sponges. Leave all four sponges to cool completely. Once cooled, the sponges can be wrapped and stored in a cool place for up to three days, or frozen for up to two months.",
   "To make the buttercream icing, put the butter and half the icing sugar in a large bowl. Mash roughly with a spatula, then beat with an electric whisk until smooth and pale. Add the remaining sugar, the vanilla, and the milk to loosen the mixture to a spreadable consistency, if needed. Beat again until smooth. Transfer half the buttercream to a second bowl and set aside.",
   "Working with the first bowl of of buttercream, spread a few tablespoons in the centre of a 20cm cake board or stand, and put one of the sponges on top, upside-down, so the flat base is on top. Spread over a quarter of the buttercream, followed by a third of the caramel. Top with another sponge, then another layer of buttercream and caramel, then repeat the process with a third sponge. Place the final sponge on top, upside-down, so you have a flat surface. Cover the entire cake in a very thin layer of the buttercream, using what remains from the first bowl – don’t worry about making it neat, as any crumbs trapped in the icing will be covered in the final coat. Chill the cake for 30 mins until the icing is firm.",
   "Stand the chilled cake in a baking tray or large roasting tin (this will catch the sprinkles while you’re decorating). Using the second bowl of buttercream, spread some onto the cake to make a wide belt around the middle – this is easiest with a small offset spatula.",
   "Press the sprinkles onto this band of icing using the palm of your hand until the entire belt is covered and the icing is no longer visible. Chill for 20 mins more until the icing and sprinkles are firm.",
   "Using a small palette knife or offset spatula, dollop most of the remaining buttercream below and above the belt of sprinkles.",
   "Then spread into thick bands that meet or slightly overlap the belt of sprinkles.",
   "Use a cake scraper or the side of a large palette knife to smooth the bands of icing, turning the cake as you go, slightly edging over the sprinkles to create the impression of a fault line with sprinkles beneath. Don’t worry about the edges being too neat – a rough edge adds to the effect.",
   "Cover the top of the cake with the remaining buttercream, using a small palette knife or cake scraper to smooth it. Use the gold decorating pen (or lustre and spirit mixture, plus a clean paint brush) to highlight the edges, including the inside edges, of the plain icing bands. If you like, you can also decorate the top of the cake with extra sprinkles. Best eaten within two days, but will keep in the fridge for up to five days. Leave to stand at room temperature for at least 1 hr before serving."

   "To serve, turn the tin upside-down onto your serving plate. Ease the loaf from the tin using the overhanging parchment and gently peel off the cling film, then the parchment. Whip the final 250ml cream with the sifted icing sugar until thick enough to hold its shape. Spoon into a food bag, snip off the corner and pipe onto the top. Scatter with sprinkles, if you like."

Slowly pour the batter into the tin, then use a spatula to get every last bit from the bowl. Bake on a middle shelf for 30-35 mins, or until the cake is risen and set on top. Cool the cake in its tin on a rack. The torte may sink and crack a little, which is fine.",

   "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Grease and line two x 23cm tins with baking parchment. Beat the butter, sugar and vanilla in a tabletop mixer (or with a hand mixer or wooden spoon) until the mixture is very light, pale and fluffy. ",
   "Gradually mix in the beaten eggs, scraping down the side of the bowl after each addition, until fully combined. If using a mixer, on slow, add the flour until just combined - don't over-beat as it can make the sponge heavy. If you're not using a mixer, fold in the flour with a large metal spoon. ",
   "Divide the mixture between the tins and bake in the oven for 30 mins or until the cakes come away from the side and the skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Remove and cool in the tin for 5 mins. Turn out onto a wire rack and remove the parchment to allow the steam to escape and the cakes to cool. Meanwhile, make the decorations. ",
   "Now assemble your cake. Before you split the sponges, trim the domed tops off each cake with a bread knife. Use the same knife or a cake wire, to split each sponge horizontally, so you're left with four sponge layers. A good tip is to cut a marker line on each sponge using a bread knife, so that once you've cut the sponges and filled them, you can use the line to put them back together in the right place. That way, if your cutting was a little wonky, it won't make the cake uneven. ",
   "Whip the double cream with the icing sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy, and just holding shape. Put the bottom layer on a cake stand or board. Spread with a thin layer of jam, then spread or pipe on a good layer of cream. Arrange an even layer of strawberries neatly round the edge, then dot the middle of the sponge with more fruit. Repeat with two more of the cake layers.",
   "For the top layer, add the sponge and jam, but neatly pipe the cream over. Gently press gold leaf onto the chocolate on the strawberries, a few meringues and some of the bark. ",
   "Arrange the chocolate-coated strawberries on top of the creamy sponge, then nestle in shards of bark, meringues and biscuit. Finish with a sprinkling of crushed meringue and a little more of the freeze-dried strawberries (from the chocolate bark recipe). Serve and eat within a few hours. "

Put 3 oven racks in your oven – if you only have 2 but have a large grill pan, this will work too, sat in the bottom of the oven.",

When all the sugar has been incorporated, the meringue should be thick, glossy and holding stiff peaks. Add the vinegar and whisk again briefly. Use a blob of meringue to stick down the corners of each piece of parchment to the trays. Divide the meringue between the 3 circles on the parchment, swirling it towards the outline to make thin circles. Scatter the almonds over, saving a few to serve on top once assembled. Bake for 1 hr, then leave to cool in the oven.",
   "When the oven is completely cold, remove the meringues and place somewhere cool and dry for up to 24 hrs, or assemble straight away. Toss the fruit with 1 tbsp icing sugar and set aside to macerate for 10-15 mins. Pour the cream, amaretto, almond extract and remaining icing sugar into a large bowl, and whisk until softly whipped. Use a little of the cream to stick your least successful meringue to a cake stand or plate. Spread over a third of the cream and scatter with some strawberries and cherries. Top with the remaining meringues, cream and fruit, finishing the top layer with the whole strawberries and cherries. Scatter over the remaining almonds and serve. Leftovers will keep in the fridge for 1 day."

   "Heat the oven to 140C/120C fan/gas 2 and line a large baking tray with baking parchment. Drain the chickpeas over a jug, reserving the liquid (this liquid, called aquafaba, will be used to make the meringue). Tip the chickpeas into a sealed container and chill for use in another recipe. Pour the liquid into a large bowl or stand mixer. Add the cream of tartar, then beat with the whisk attachment or an electric whisk for 15-18 mins until the mixture has tripled in size and is holding stiff peaks (it will take a while for it to thicken initially, so just keep beating until this happens). Add the caster sugar 1 tbsp at a time, whisking well between each addition until all the sugar has been incorporated and you are left with a fluffy meringue.",
   "Use a little of the meringue to stick the baking parchment to the tray, then spoon the meringue into the centre of the parchment and spread into a roughly 15cm round pavlova, making the sides slightly higher than the middle (it will deflate and spread a little more in the oven). Bake on the bottom shelf of the oven for 2 hrs. The meringue will still feel slightly soft once cooked, but as it cools it will set and be able to come away from the parchment easily. Leave to cool completely. The meringue can be cooked up to two days in advance. Once it has cooled completely, wrap well or keep in an airtight container.",
   "Cut the pith from the oranges using a serrated knife, then slice into rounds. Dust the oranges with the icing sugar and cinnamon. Place the pavlova on a serving plate, spoon the coconut yogurt into the middle, then top with the cinnamon oranges, cranberries and pistachios."

Rinse out the cream pan and pour in the mixture. Return to the heat and cook gently, whisking all the time, until it reaches 88C – you’ll need a digital thermometer to test this. When it reaches this temperature, it will have thickened and the egg will be cooked. Pass the mix through a fine sieve into a clean bowl. Pour in the whisky, then squeeze any excess water out of the soaked gelatine and add to the bowl. Stir until all the gelatine has melted, then leave to cool a little. Pour into 4 small or 2 large glass dishes, leaving enough room for the jelly, and place in the fridge for at least 4 hours until set.",

Remove from the heat, squeeze out any excess water from the gelatine, add to the pan and stir until melted. Pass the jelly through a fine sieve into a jug and place to one side to cool completely.",
   "Once the cream layer has set, remove from the fridge and pour over the cooled jelly. If you have some left, don’t worry, just leave it to set in the fridge and eat it on its own. Return to the fridge and chill until the jelly has set. Can be made up to 2 days in advance; once set, cover with cling film and store in the fridge.",
   "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. To make the crumble, rub the butter into the flour until it resembles crumbs, then mix in the remaining ingredients. Tip onto a baking tray and bake for 15-20 mins or until golden brown. You will need to stir it a few times to ensure it cooks evenly. Remove from the oven and leave to cool. When cool, bash to a semi-fine crumble. Store in an airtight container until ready to serve.",

Beat in a third of the egg white mixture to loosen, then gently fold in the rest of the egg white mixture until you have a light batter. Pour this into the prepared tin, spread out to the edges using a palette knife and bake for 12-15 mins until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.",
   "Sprinkle caster sugar over a large sheet of baking parchment. Turn the sponge out onto the sugared parchment, then peel off the sheet that lined the tin. Cover with a clean tea towel, then leave to cool fully.",
   "While the sponge cools, make the decoration. Spoon 2 tbsp of the melted caramel chocolate over a sheet of baking parchment and spread it into a 10cm circle using the back of the spoon. This will be the reindeer face. Arrange the two pretzel halves at the top to make antlers. Spoon 1 tsp of the melted chocolate onto the parchment and spread into a small circle, then repeat three times (these will be the hooves). Chill for 10 mins to set.",
   "Trim the edges of the cooled sponge, then with one of the shorter ends closest to you, score along the inside edge using a sharp knife. Roll the sponge up from the scored edge, using the parchment to make it easier, then unroll and set aside.",
   "To make the buttercream, tip the butter, icing sugar and cocoa into a large bowl and beat with an electric whisk for 4-5 mins until smooth and creamy. Or, do this in a stand mixer. Add 2-4 tbsp boiling water from the kettle and whisk until the mixture is soft but still holds its shape. Spread a thin, even layer over the sponge, then carefully roll it back up.",
   "Spoon the remaining buttercream into a piping bag with a ‘grass’-style nozzle – that’s one with many small holes in it that will create a ‘furry’ texture. Place the rolled sponge on a serving plate or cake stand. Pipe the buttercream all over the outside of the roll, except the front. Squeeze as you start to pipe, then slowly lift the nozzle away for longer strands.",
   "Roll a marble-sized piece of red fondant and attach to the middle of the face using buttercream. Roll two pea-sized pieces of black fondant into small boomerang shapes for closed eyes and attach these above the nose with more buttercream.",
   "Arrange the chocolate hooves on either side of the roll. Pipe a little buttercream on the front of the roll, then attach the face. Will keep in an airtight container for three days."

   "Put 150g water and all the dough ingredients, apart from the butter, into the bowl of a mixer with a beater paddle. Mix on a medium speed for 8 mins or until the dough starts coming away from the sides and forms a ball. Turn off the mixer and let the dough rest for 1 min.",
   "Start the mixer up again on a medium speed and slowly add the butter to the dough – about 25g at a time. Once it is all incorporated, mix on high speed for 5 mins until the dough is glossy, smooth and very elastic when pulled.",
   "Cover the bowl with cling film or a clean tea towel and leave to prove until it has doubled in size. Knock back the dough in the bowl briefly, then re-cover and put in the fridge to chill overnight.",
   "The next day, take the dough out of the fridge and cut it into 50g pieces (you should get about 20).",
   "Roll the dough pieces into smooth, tight buns and place them on a floured baking tray, leaving plenty of room between them, as you don’t want them to stick together while they prove.",
   "Cover loosely with cling film and leave for 4 hrs or until doubled in size. Fill your deep-fat fryer or heavy-based saucepan halfway with oil. Heat the oil to 180C.",
   "When the oil is heated, carefully slide the doughnuts from the tray using a floured pastry scraper. Taking care not to deflate them, put them into the oil. Do 2-3 per batch, depending on the size of your fryer or pan.",
   "Fry for 2 mins each side until golden brown – they puff up and float, so you may need to gently push them down after about 1 min to help them colour evenly.",
   "Remove the doughnuts from the fryer and place them on kitchen paper.",
   "Toss the doughnuts in a bowl of caster sugar while still warm. Repeat the steps until all the doughnuts are fried, but keep checking the oil temperature is correct – if it is too high, they will burn and be raw in the middle; if it is too low, the oil will be absorbed into the doughnuts and they will become greasy. Set aside to cool before filling.",
   "To fill the doughnuts, make a hole with a small knife in the crease of each one, anywhere around the white line between the fried top and bottom.",
   "Fill a piping bag with your filling and pipe into the doughnut until nicely swollen – 20-50g is the optimum quantity, depending on the filling; cream will be less, because it is more aerated. After filling, the doughnuts are best eaten straight away, but will keep in an airtight tin.",
   "FillingsCustard filling: Try out Justin's custard filling and, if you like, add different flavours to the custard as follows...Brown sugar: Replace the caster sugar with half soft dark brown sugar and half light brown sugar. You can add chopped stem ginger to the finished custard, or some hazelnut praline. Finish with half the quantity of cream.Chocolate: Whisk 150g dark (70%) chocolate into the milk. Finish with half the cream.Coffee: Add 4 tbsp of freshly ground strong coffee to the milk.Malt \u0026 vanilla: Mix 2 tbsp of powdered malt into the sugar, and 2 tbsp of liquid malt into the milk.Saffron: Add a good pinch of saffron to the milk. Finish with half the quantity of cream.Violet custard: Add 3 tsp of violet extract and 3 tbsp of violet liqueur to the finished custard. Sprinkle sugared violets and crushed Parma Violet sweets over the top of the filled doughnuts."

   "Fill the pastry case with the cream, piped in blobs or just spread over the base, and arrange the strawberries on top. If they’re nice and small, just lay them in, pointedside up. If large, slice them about the thickness of a £1 coin, then layer them in overlapping slices, using the bigger slices for the middle of the tart and the smaller ones towards the edge. Sift some more of the lavender sugar on top and serve."

Pour the custard through a sieve and cover with cling film to stop a skin forming while it cools.",
   "Once the parkin is cooked, turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.",
   "You can now assemble the trifle – cut the parkin into 16 squares and crumble or slice a few of these to fit the base of a large trifle bowl. Add just less than half of the compote and a few whole blackberries, then pour over half the custard. Give the dish a gentle shake to level the mixture, then repeat the layering process once more, reserving a few cubes of parkin. Pour a spiral of compote over the top of the final layer of custard, then use a skewer to drag spokes out from the centre to create a marbled effect. Scatter over a few whole blackberries, then chill until ready to serve. Just before serving, add the reserved parkin and the crystallised ginger, then dust with icing sugar."

   "Butter the bread. Drain the ricotta (if there is any liquid on top), then add the icing sugar to it. Spread the buttered bread thickly with ricotta. Sprinkle the citrus zest on top, then layer these slices with the rhubarb in a 20 x 30cm ovenproof dish. Pour the egg and cream mixture through a sieve and leave to sit for 30 mins (this makes the pudding lighter).",

Leave to cool for about 10 mins (the pudding will continue to cook and ‘set’ during this time). Dust with icing sugar and serve with crème fraîche, or cream mixed with Greek yogurt."

   "Whisk the egg yolk with 2 tbsp cold water, and drizzle over the flour mixture. Use the pulse button to blend the mixture once more, keep going until it starts to form larger clumps. If the mixture seems too dry, add a little more water a tsp or 2 at a time, but no more than 3 tsp in total.",
   "Tip out onto a work surface and briefly knead the dough to bring it together into a smooth ball. Avoid overworking or it will become tough. Flatten the dough into a puck shape and wrap well in cling film. Chill for at least 30 mins, or for up to 2 days, or freeze for 2 months.",
   "Next, make the filling. Put the figs, raspberries, sugar and cornflour in a large bowl and gently toss together, being careful not to break up the raspberries, until the fruit is well coated. Put the cardamom in a mortar and crack the pods with a pestle. Remove the seeds from their pods and place them back in the mortar, discarding the pods. Crush the seeds then add to the fruit, along with the rosewater. Set aside for 15 mins.",
   "Remove the dough from the fridge and divide into 2 pieces, one slightly larger than the other. Re-wrap the smaller piece and set aside. Divide the larger piece of dough into the number of pies you’d like to make, or leave whole for a large one. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to the thickness of a 50p piece, or until large enough to line the base of your pie plate or tin, with a little pastry overhanging. Roll the dough over your rolling pin, lift into your plate or tins, and press it well into the corners. Scatter the polenta or almonds over and spoon in the filling. Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5 and place a baking sheet on the middle shelf.",
   "To create a stamped design for the top of the pie, roll out the pastry on a well-floured sheet of baking parchment . Use a small biscuit cutter to stamp out shapes (we’ve used a heart cutter, but circles, diamonds or flower shapes look pretty too). Brush the pie edge with egg, then slide the pastry lid on top. Trim the edge with scissors and squeeze the pastry edge around the top of your index finger, using your thumb and the other index finger. Work your way along the pastry edge to give a professionally fluted finish. Once covered, whisk the reserved egg white and brush over the pastry. Scatter with a little extra sugar, then place the pie on the baking sheet and bake for 45 mins for a large pie, 35-40 mins for medium pies or 25-30 mins for mini pies, until the pastry is golden and crisp and the juices are bubbling. Cool for 10 mins before serving with cream, crème fraîche, natural yogurt or soured cream."

   "For the candied lemon slices, tip the sugar into a saucepan with 200ml water. Heat gently to dissolve the sugar, then bring the syrup to the boil. Drop in the lemon slices and cook for 15 mins until softened. Carefully remove the slices from the syrup and place on a piece of baking parchment to dry. (Lift them gently as they will be quite delicate, and you want to keep them in rounds if possible.) Keep the remaining syrup for brushing over the cake.",
   "Heat oven to 180C/160 fan/gas 4. Grease and line the bases of two 20cm springform cake tins. Make the four sponges in two batches. To make the first batch, in a stand mixer or in a large bowl using an electric hand whisk, beat 175g butter with 175g sugar and the zest of 1 lemon until creamy. Gently beat three of the eggs together in a jug. Gradually add the egg to the mixture, scraping down the side and whisking well after each addition. In a separate bowl, mix together 200g self-raising flour, 1 tsp baking powder and a pinch of salt, and fold this into the cake mixture. Finally, stir in 300g courgette and 1 tbsp thyme leaves. Divide the mixture between the tins and bake for 25 mins or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.",
   "While the sponges are still warm, prick all over with a skewer and brush over a little of the reserved lemon syrup. Once cool enough to handle, remove from the tins and place on a wire rack. Make and cook the second batch of cakes using the remaining ingredients – you can use the same baking parchment, just re-grease the parchment and the sides of the tins.",
   "When the cakes are cool, make the icing. Whisk all the ingredients together with a pinch of salt until smooth and fluffy.",
   "Using a cake turntable, if you have one, sandwich the cakes together with a little of the icing. Using a palette knife, spread a thin layer of icing all around the cake and chill for 30 mins to set. (This layer is known as a ‘crumb coat’ because it traps any loose crumbs on the surface of the cake – so when you put a second layer of icing on, the cake will be nice and smooth.) If you are short of time, put it in the freezer for 5 mins.",
   "Once chilled, completely cover the cake in a second layer of icing to achieve a smooth finish. Stick the crystallised thyme and candied lemon slices over one side of the cake and top as if they are cascading.",
   "Return the cake to the fridge or freezer until the icing has completely set. For extra shimmer, use a thin paintbrush to brush a little of the gold paint across the lemon slices for a burnished, autumnal effect, and dot pieces of gold leaf as you go, if you like."

   "Weigh the flour, sugar and 1 /2 tsp salt into a large bowl or the bowl of a tabletop mixer. Add the yeast, 100ml warm water, the eggs and the butter or coconut oil, then mix with a wooden spoon until it becomes a smooth, sticky dough.",
   "Tip the dough onto a work surface and knead for 10 mins or until it feels stretchy and silky – if it sticks to your hands at first, add a little extra flour, but don’t be tempted to add too much as this will make the dough heavy. Clean the bowl and oil it lightly, return the dough and turn over until coated in oil. Wrap the bowl in cling film and set aside in a warm place for 2-3 hrs until doubled in size. Alternatively, mix in a tabletop mixer for 5-8 mins until the dough starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl.",
   "Once the dough has risen, tip it onto the work surface and punch out any air bubbles. Roll it out to a rectangle roughly 2cm thick. Using an 8cm biscuit cutter, stamp out as many circles as you can – you should get 12 if you scrunch up and re-roll the trimmings. Use a smaller biscuit cutter (about 2cm) or a large piping nozzle to stamp out a hole in the middle of each doughnut. Arrange the doughnuts and the doughnut holes over two baking trays, cover with lightly oiled cling film and leave to rise for 1 hr or until almost doubled in size again.",
   "While the doughnuts rise, make the icing by combining the coconut milk and icing sugar in a bowl. Divide the icing into as many bowls as the number of colours you’d like to use, then add a drop of food colouring to colour each one a vivid shade.",
   "Half-fill a deep fryer or large pan with oil and heat to 180C. If you don’t have a thermometer, check the temperature with a piece of bread – it’ll turn golden brown in about 45 secs when the oil is ready.",
   "When you’re ready to fry, have a plate lined with kitchen paper to hand. Drop one or two ring doughnuts and a few doughnut holes into the pan at a time, making sure you don’t overcrowd it. Cook the doughnuts for 2-3 mins each side until deep golden brown, then flip over and cook for another 2-3 mins. When the doughnuts are cooked, drain on kitchen paper.",
   "When all the doughnuts and doughnut holes have been cooked, dip into the coloured icings. Top some of the doughnuts with coconut shavings, if you like. Best served on the day, but will keep for 2 days in a tin."

   "Mix the yeast, flour, mixed spice, sugar and 1 tsp salt in a big bowl. Whisk together the milk, melted butter and egg, then tip into the flour mixture and stir until it forms a sticky dough. Tip onto a work surface and knead for about 8 mins until the dough feels soft and stretchy. Clean the bowl, then butter it. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with buttered cling film and set aside for about 1-2 hrs, or until doubled in size, or chill for up to 24 hrs. In a small pan, simmer the cranberries, mixed dried fruit, zests and orange juice until the fruit looks plump. Leave to cool.",
   "When you’re ready to shape the stollen, heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Tip the dough onto a surface lightly dusted with flour. Roll out to a 50 x 30cm rectangle. Grate the marzipan over the surface of the dough (this is easier to do if the marzipan is cold). Scatter the soaked fruit and half the nuts evenly over the top, then press down lightly with your hands so they stick into the dough a bit.",
   "With a long side facing you, roll up the dough as tightly as you’re able to, like a Swiss roll (see step 1 of our step-by-step guide). Pinch the dough together to seal the open edge, then use a large knife to cut the sausage of dough in half along its length, leaving one end intact by about 5cm (see step 2). You should now have two long strips of dough to work with. Move the dough onto a large baking sheet, oiled and lined with parchment. Twist the two pieces together, turning the cut edges outwards to expose the marzipan and fruit filling (see step 3). Once twisted, connect the two ends to make a wreath shape about 26cm in diameter with a 12cm hole in the middle. Tuck one end under the other to hide the uncut piece of dough (see step 4). Cover loosely with oiled cling film and leave the bread to prove for 30-40 mins until risen by roughly a third.",
   "Uncover the bread and bake for 40-45 mins until the dough is golden all over. You may want to rotate the tray halfway through cooking to get even results. Leave to cool on the tray for 20 mins.",
   "Meanwhile, mix the icing sugar with enough lemon juice to make a thick but pourable icing. Drizzle over the wreath, then scatter with the rest of the nuts. Will keep in a tin, or well wrapped, for up to three days."

Then place in the oven and cook for about 18-20 mins until well risen and brown. Remove the profiteroles from the oven and cut a small slit in the base of each one so they don’t collapse. Cool on a wire rack.",
   "When they’re cold, whip the cream lightly until just holding its shape. Sweeten to taste with remaining sugar and a few drops of vanilla extract. Cut the profiteroles in half, fill them with the sweetened cream and pile them up on a plate. You can refrigerate them for 1-2 hrs at this point but not for any longer as the pastry will go soggy.",

Reduce the speed, slowly add the flour, then just before it’s fully combined, add the egg yolk and mix briefly until smooth (if the pastry is dry add 1 tsp cold water).

Trim the edges neatly, then chill in the fridge for 20 mins.",
   "Stand the tart tin (if using) on a baking sheet, then spoon in the frangipane and smooth with the back of the spoon, leaving a 0.5cm gap at the top. Peel and core the apples, then cut into 4mm slices using a mandolin or knife across the width of the apple so there’s a hole in the middle of each slice. Arrange the apples on top of the frangipane. Sieve a good layer of icing sugar on top, then bake for 1 hr-1 hr 15 mins or until the apples are caramelised and the frangipane is cooked (use a skewer to check). Leave to cool for 30 mins before serving.",
   "Next make the Chantilly. Whip the double cream and icing sugar to soft peaks, then add the Calvados and vanilla seeds, and whisk again until the mixture holds its shape. Chill in the fridge until you are ready to serve with the tart."

Transfer the beaters to the egg yolk bowl (no need to clean the beaters first) and whisk until the mixture is thick and pale. Lift the beaters and drizzle the mixture around the bowl – a ribbon should sit on the surface for 2-3 secs.",

Sprinkle the flour and almond mixture evenly over the surface, then drizzle the cooled butter around the edge of the bowl. Fold everything together until just combined, making sure you scoop the spoon right down to the bottom of the bowl to catch the butter and any pockets of flour. Divide the mixture between the cake tins, level the surfaces, then bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 22-25 mins. Test the cakes are done by inserting a skewer into the centre – it should come out clean. Cool in their tins on a wire rack for 30 mins, then remove the tins and parchment, and leave to cool completely.",
   "Boil the kettle. Put the gelatine in a bowl of cold water and set aside to soften. Pour 150ml cream and 50ml hot water into a saucepan. Add the matcha powder and whisk over a gentle heat until well combined and steaming. Remove from the heat. Squeeze the water from the gelatine leaves and add them, one by one, to the hot matcha cream, whisking until they’re dissolved. Pour the warm cream into a bowl and put in the fridge to cool to room temperature – don’t leave it too long or the gelatine will set.",
   "Line the deepest of your 20cm cake tins with a double layer of cling film, ensuring the sides are well covered. Put one of the sponges in the tin, flattest-side down. Pour the remaining 450ml cream into a bowl and add the icing sugar. Whip until the cream is holding soft peaks, then fold through the cooled matcha cream. Scrape the cream into the cake tin and level the surface. Put the remaining sponge on top, flattest-side facing up, pushing the sponge gently into the cream. Wrap the tin in cling film and chill for at least 4 hrs.",

Remove the cake from the fridge and unwrap the tin. Invert the cake onto a cake stand or plate and remove from the tin and the cling film. Using a palette knife held at a 90-degree angle to the side of the cake, scrape around the edge to remove any excess mousse and give the cake a smooth finish. Using baking parchment, create a tight collar, sitting about 2cm taller than the cake. Pour the cooled chocolate glaze over the top, smoothing it to the edge – the collar should prevent it from dribbling down the sides. Chill for 30 mins more, or for up to 24 hrs.",
   "Carefully pull off the parchment collar. Hold a chopping board (or another object with a straight edge) over half the cake and dust the exposed surface with icing sugar. Arrange fresh cherries and cherry blossom or another edible flower on top, if you like, and serve immediately."

Pour the cake mixture evenly into the two tins, and bake for 25-30 mins until risen and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Cool in the tins for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack, peel off the baking parchment and leave to cool.",

Add the cream cheese and sieve in the remaining icing sugar, mash together again, then blend once more with the hand mixer. Put the Oreos in a food processor and whizz to fine crumbs. Add the biscuit crumbs to the icing and mix again until combined.",
   "Next, make the cookie cake toppers. You’ll need one Oreo for each letter of the word you’d like to write – someone’s name or, like we have done, ‘WOW!’ Carefully insert a skewer into the creamy filling in the middle of each Oreo – some cookies may break, so save these ones for later. Melt the chocolate in the microwave, stirring every 20 secs or so, or in a heatproof bowl suspended over a pan of gently simmering water. Spread a little chocolate over the surface of one side of each cookie. Roll out the fondant icing to the thickness of a 50p coin, and cut out your letters, then stick these to the cookies and set aside to dry. Alternatively, let the chocolate dry, then use an icing pen to write the name or word directly on the surface.",
   "To assemble the cake, stick one of your sponges to a cake stand or board with a little of the cream cheese icing. Use roughly half the icing to stack the remaining cakes on top, spreading a generous amount between each layer. Pile the remaining icing on top of the assembled cake, and use a palette knife to ease it over the edges, covering the entire surface of the cake. Tidy the plate with a piece of kitchen paper.",
   "If you have any leftover Oreos, break them into pieces and push these around the base of the cake. Insert the dried cookie cake toppers into the top of the cake and serve. Store leftovers in the fridge for up to 2 days, but bring back to room temperature for an hour or so before eating."

Mix the icing sugar with enough orange juice to make a thick icing and transfer it to a small disposable piping bag or plastic sandwich bag. You can spray the pistachios with gold spray at this point, if you like.",

   "Heat oven to 140C/120C fan/gas 1 and line 2 large baking sheets with baking parchment. First, set up your piping bags. You will need 3 disposable piping bags for the 3 flavours. Using a wet paintbrush, paint lines of undiluted food colouring along the inside of the piping bags. Be quite generous, because you want bold colours. Wash the brush well between each colour so they don’t mix. Snip off the end of 1 bag and drop in an extra-large round piping nozzle, then put the bags to one side.",
   "Tip the egg whites into a large mixing bowl or table-top mixer – make sure it’s grease-free before you start. Whisk the eggs with an electric hand whisk or in your mixer, until they hold soft peaks. Begin adding the sugar 1 tbsp at a time, whisking continuously, until you have a thick and glossy meringue, which will hold up in a stiff peak on the end of the whisk. Divide the meringue into 3 bowls and swirl through your chosen flavourings (to correspond to the piping bag colours). You want to achieve a marbled effect rather than thoroughly mixing it all in.",
   "Put the piping bag fitted with your nozzle into a tall glass or jug and roll the piping bag down over the lip of the jug to hold it in place. Fill the bag with the correct flavoured meringue to match the colour in the bag. Lift up and twist the end to seal.",
   "Hold the piping bag about 2cm vertically above the baking tray. Apply an even pressure to the bag, slowly lifting the bag as you squeeze, to make a smooth round meringue, approximately 6cm wide. To finish with a nice peak at the top, push down a little on the mixture then quickly pull the nozzle away.",
   "Continue until all the mixture in the bag is used up, leaving enough room for the meringues to spread a little. Quickly remove the nozzle, wash it and dry well, then drop in the next piping bag. Continue with the remaining mixtures until it they are all used up and you have 2 trays covered with 3 colours of meringues.",
   "Bake for 1 hr, turning the heat down to 120C/100C fan/gas ½ for the final 30 mins. Remove from the oven and cool on wire racks while you make another batch of meringues with the remaining 3 flavours, if you like. Can be made up to a week ahead and kept in an airtight container, or serve with our flavoured creams (see tips, below)."

  "Method": [
   "To make the pastry, sift the flour into a bowl with a pinch of salt, sugar and ground ginger. Rub in the butter until you have a breadcrumb consistency, then add 30-50ml of cold water, stirring with a flat-bladed knife until the crumbs form a dough. Knead the pastry briefly until smooth, then wrap in cling film and refrigerate for 30 mins.",
   "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Arrange the rhubarb in the tray in a neat layer, scatter over 250g of the sugar and scrape out the vanilla pod over it. Add the orange juice and zest and cover tightly with foil. Bake for 20-30 mins, until the rhubarb is soft. Remove from the oven and cool. Strain off the syrup using a sieve – you’ll need this later for the meringue.",
   "Roll out the pastry on a floured surface. Line a 20cm tart tin, leaving an overhang. Pop into the fridge to chill for 30 mins. Once chilled, cover the case with baking parchment, fill with baking beans and blind bake for 25 mins, until golden. Remove the baking beans and bake for 5 mins more to crisp up the bottom. Allow to cool, then remove from the tin to a plate.",
   "For the custard, combine the remaining sugar with the egg yolks and whisk vigorously, until really pale and frothy. Gently heat the cream and milk in a pan until it’s almost boiling. Remove from the heat and briefly allow to cool before pouring a little of the cream mix onto the egg yolks and stirring to combine. Pour the egg yolk mix back into the pan and heat gently, stirring with a wooden spoon. Cook until the mixture coats the back of a spoon (about 5 mins). Remove from the heat and pour into a jug or mixing bowl.",
   "Divide the rhubarb in half, reserving the pinkest, prettiest lengths. Blitz the other half to a purée in a food processor and add to the custard. Fill the tart and top with the rhubarb. Chill until needed.",
   "To make the Italian meringue, measure out 160g of the rhubarb poaching syrup and bring to the boil. You need to it be about 118C (this will cook the egg whites to set the meringue). In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk the egg whites until they form soft peaks. Add the cream of tartar and mix. When the syrup has reached 118C on a cooking thermometer, carefully pour it down the sides of the stand mixer and whisk until you have a smooth, fluffy meringue. Fill a piping bag with a medium star nozzle and pipe little meringue kisses over the tart. Use a blowtorch to gently scorch the meringue and serve straight away.  "

   "Meanwhile, scatter the rest of the sugar into an ovenproof frying pan about 20cm across, and heat it gently until it melts and starts to caramelise. Tip the pan if you need to combine patches of sugar that haven’t melted into the liquid parts, but don’t be tempted to stir. When you have a medium amber-coloured caramel, sprinkle on the spices and lemon juice. Turn the heat off.",
   "Take the squash out of the oven and leave to cool for a couple of mins. Use tongs to place the squash in the frying pan, gently arranging the slices in a tight spiral on the caramel. Start with a large slice in the centre and lay the other slices on top so it looks neat when you turn it out. When the squash is all in the pan, turn the heat on again and cook until the caramel starts to bubble. Turn the heat down and cook for about 10-15 mins, making sure the caramel doesn’t burn. You want the squash to give off any water and then to start absorbing the caramel – the caramel will start to get very liquid as this happens, so turn the heat up at the end and make sure the caramel thickens up completely. Turn the heat off, drop the butter into the centre of the pan and wait for it to melt.",
   "Cut the pastry into a rough circle just bigger than the pan and drape it over the squash, folding any excess over on itself and carefully tucking it in around the edge. Bake for 20 mins, then turn the heat down to 160C/140C fan/gas 3 and bake for a further 20 mins. Turn out onto a plate while the tarte is hot so the squash and caramel release easily. Serve with crème fraîche or ice cream."

Pour back into the pan and warm through on the hob until just steaming, but not boiling, then strain onto the chopped chocolate, discarding the cardamom pods. Leave to stand for a few mins, then stir until smooth and glossy. Add the warm chocolate cream to the egg, whisking as you go, until combined.

  "Method": [
   "Rub the butter into the flour until the mix looks like fine breadcrumbs. Stir in the icing sugar, then make a well and use a round-bladed knife to stir in the oil, egg yolk and 1½-2 tbsp cold water until dough comes together. Without overhandling, gather into a ball. On a lightly floured surface, roll out so it fits a 23 x 2cm loose-bottom flan tin. Ease the pastry into the tin, then trim the edges by rolling the rolling pin over the top. Press the pastry into the flutes so it sits very slightly proud of the edge (this extra height helps in case of any shrinkage). Lightly prick the pastry base with a fork, then chill for about 10 mins. Heat the oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5.",
   "Meanwhile, make the filling. Beat the eggs and egg whites together with a wooden spoon until well mixed. Sift the icing sugar into a bowl, then gradually beat in the eggs. If the mix is at all lumpy, simply beat with a wire whisk. Stir in the lemon zest and the juice. Leave to stand so the lemon flavour can develop.",
   "Sit the chilled pastry case on a baking sheet. Line with baking parchment and baking beans and bake blind for 20 mins until well set. Carefully lift out the beans and paper, then bake the pastry case for another 3-5 mins until the base is cooked and pale golden.",
   "Strain the lemon mixture through a sieve. Beat the crème fraîche in a medium bowl until smooth, then slowly stir in the lemon mix until well blended. Transfer to a jug, then carefully pour two thirds into the warm pastry case. Place in the oven with the oven shelf half out, pour in the rest of the filling, then carefully slide the shelf back in. Reduce the heat to 150C/130C fan/gas 2. Bake for 25-30 mins until barely set with a slight wobble in the middle. Cool for about 1 hr, then serve with a light dusting of icing sugar. Best eaten the same day."
