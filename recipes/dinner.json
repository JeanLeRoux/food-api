  "Description": "Mix up your festive main with this fabulous Christmas dinner wellington. A make-ahead meal in one, it incorporates stuffing and cranberry sauce, so all you need to think about on the big day is the veg and gravy",
  "Ingredients": [
   [
    "1 tbsp oil",
    "1 onion, finely chopped",
    "6 chicken breasts",
    "400g sausagemeat",
    "small bunch winter herbs (we used rosemary, thyme and sage), chopped",
    "100g fresh breadcumbs",
    "10 slices prosciutto or parma ham",
    "250g jar cranberry sauce",
    "2 x 500g blocks all-butter puff pastry",

    "1 egg, plus 1 yolk",
    "roast potatoes, vegetables and gravy, to serve (optional)"

  ],
  "Method": [
   "Heat the oil in a pan. Add the onion and cook for 8-10 mins until soft. Tip into a bowl and leave to cool.",
   "Cover a chopping board with cling film and place a chicken breast on top. Cover the chicken with more cling film. Use a rolling pin to gently bash the thicker part of the chicken until the whole chicken breast is an even thickness of about ½cm. Repeat with the remaining breasts.",
   "Mix the sausagemeat, herbs and breadcrumbs into the cooled onions. On your worktop, make a double layer of cling film, about 30 x 40cm in size. Lay the prosciutto on top, covering as much of the cling film's surface area as possible. Top with the chicken breasts, placing them to fit together (cut into smaller pieces if you need to) and arranging them to completely cover the prosciutto. Season the chicken.",
   "Cover the chicken with the sausagemeat mixture, spreading it right to the edges. Stir the cranberry sauce to loosen it, then spread over the sausagemeat. Roll the chicken up tightly from one of the longer sides (using the cling film to help you but keeping the cling film on the outside), encasing the fillings in a spiral inside. The prosciutto should be the outermost layer. Wrap the roulade in a large sheet of cling film and twist at the ends to seal, then freeze for 30 mins.",
   "On a floured surface, roll out one block of pastry to the thickness of a £1 coin. Place on a baking tray lined with parchment. Unwrap the chicken roulade and place on top of the pastry. Trim the pastry to a rectangle, leaving 2-3cm all the way around the base of the roulade. Save the off-cuts for decorating the top.",
   "Roll out the second piece of pastry to the same thickness as the first. Whisk together the egg and extra yolk and brush a little around the edge of the pastry base. Drape the second piece of pastry over the roulade, moulding it tightly around the meat and pushing out any air pockets. Trim off any excess pastry, leaving a border of about 2cm.",
   "Crimp the border with your thumb and forefingers, or use a fork to press around the edge to seal (flour the fork if the pastry begins to stick). Brush the wellington all over with the egg wash. Use the reserved pastry off-cuts to decorate the wellington as you like, or score through the top layer with a sharp knife. Cover and chill for at least 1 hr, or for up to 48 hrs. Can be frozen at this stage for up to two months (defrost in the fridge before cooking). When you’re ready to cook, heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.",
   "If you have any egg wash left over, brush the wellington with a little more just before baking. Cook for 1 hr 15 mins until the pastry is golden and crisp. If you've previously frozen the wellington, make sure it's cooked through by poking a sharp knife into the centre and checking the tip comes out very hot. Serve with mash or roast potatoes, veg and gravy, if you like. Chicken is much juicier than beef, so have some kitchen paper to hand ready for when you cut into the wellington."

  "Method": [
   "Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Squeeze the meat from one of the chipolatas into a bowl, discarding the skin. Put the grated apple in a clean tea towel and squeeze out any excess liquid, then add to the sausagemeat with the pecans, a quarter of the bread and the sage. Season, then combine using your hands and form into a fat sausage shape. Cut a long slit in the chicken breast lengthways on one side, being careful not to cut it in half (you should be able to open it up like a book). Stuff the chicken breast with the stuffing sausage, then wrap two of the bacon rashers around it so it’s fully enclosed, securing it with a couple of cocktail sticks. ",
   "Put the stuffed chicken breast in a large roasting tin. Wrap the remaining bacon rashers around the remaining chipolatas and add to the tin around the chicken.",
   "Add the apple wedges, sprouts and potatoes to the roasting tin. Cut the parsnip in half lengthways and put it, cut-side down, on a chopping board. Make very thin, close cuts into the parsnip halves that go almost but not fully through – put a wooden spoon on either side of the parsnip halves to stop the knife going through, if you like. Transfer to the roasting tin with the garlic and two of the bay leaves. Drizzle over the oil and season everything with salt and pepper. Roast for 40-45 mins, or until everything is cooked through. Brush the vegetables in the oil and meat juices once or twice near the end of the cooking time. ",
   "Meanwhile, pour the milk into a small saucepan with the remaining bay leaf, the cloves and shallot. Heat gently for 5-6 mins, stirring occasionally, or until the shallot is starting to soften. Strain the milk into a heatproof jug, reserving the shallot and discarding the bay leaf and cloves. Return the milk to the pan with the remaining bread and cook, stirring, until you have a thick, porridge-like sauce. Add half the butter and stir until melted, then season, remove from the heat and set aside. ",
   "Slice the reserved shallot, then add to a deep frying pan with the rest of the butter. Fry until just golden, then pour in the balsamic vinegar. Continue to cook until the vinegar has reduced and is thick and sticky, then add the wine. Cook until the wine has reduced by half, then stir in the stock and bubble until the sauce is glossy and slightly thickened. ",
   "Gently reheat the bread sauce. Slice half the chicken (reserving the rest for leftovers) and put on a plate with the pigs in blankets and the roast apple, sprouts, potatoes and parsnip. Drizzle over the red wine gravy and serve with the pickled red cabbage and cranberry and bread sauces on the side. "

   "For tray one, mash the butter, 1 tsp mace, half the sage and all the garlic with some seasoning. Use your hands to separate the turkey meat and skin to create a pocket. Spread half the spiced butter under the skin and smooth into an even layer, taking care not to pierce the skin. Rub the remaining butter over the skin and season again. Put the onion slices in your second largest roasting tin (tray one), and sit the turkey on top. Roast for 1 hr-1 hr 30 mins in the middle of the oven (1 hr for a 2kg crown, 1 hr 30 mins for a 3kg turkey crown), basting with the butter that pools in the bottom halfway through.",
   "Meanwhile, for tray two, cook the potatoes in the boiling water for 8 mins, then add the parsnips and cook for another 3-5 mins until just tender. Lift both out of the pan using a slotted spoon into a wide bowl and leave them to steam-dry. Put the carrots in the pan and cook for 5 mins. Add the sprouts and cook for 2-4 mins more until just tender. Reserve a jug of the cooking water (about 500ml) and drain the carrots and sprouts. Leave to steam-dry.",
   "To make the stuffing, mix the sausagemeat, cranberry sauce, prunes, and remaining mace and sage with seasoning. Mix well with your hands, then roll into 16 stuffing balls. Wrap each with a halved bacon slice and chill until needed.",
   "When the turkey has had its time, baste again and add the stuffing balls around it, as far apart as possible to ensure they brown. Move to the bottom of the oven, roasting for another 30 mins. Put a shelf above for the potatoes, and heat the oil in your largest shallow roasting tin (tray two) at the top of the oven for 10 mins.",
   "Season the potatoes and parsnips, and sprinkle over 2 tbsp flour. Put a plate over the bowl, hold it down, and shake to toss the spuds and parsnips in the flour. Gently lower them into the hot oil, and spoon over the fat. Roast for 30 mins, turning them halfway through.",
   "When the turkey has had 1 hr 30 mins (or 2 hrs for a 3kg turkey crown), check it’s cooked through – a digital cooking thermometer should read 70C when inserted into the middle of the breast, and there should be no pink juices when pierced with a skewer. Remove from the tin and leave to rest along with the stuffing, covered with foil (you can warm them up in the second tray if you need to later on). ",
   "Turn the oven up to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and roast the potatoes for 10 more mins until lightly golden. Toss the carrots, sprouts and bay leaves into the roast potato tray, and roast for another 30 mins while the turkey rests, until all the veg is golden and tender. Add the stuffing balls for the last 5 mins to crisp and warm through again, if you like.",
   "Add the port or wine to the turkey tray with the roasted onions, and put over a low heat on the hob (or transfer to a pan if your tray isn’t flameproof), scraping any bits off the bottom. Add most of the reserved cooking water and whisk everything together. Mash the 1 tbsp butter with the 2 tbsp flour to make a paste, then whisk into the gravy. Simmer for 10 mins until thickened. Season, and strain into a gravy jug. "

Continue to cook until the liquid has reduced by about half, then remove from the heat.",
   "Meanwhile, cook the linguine in a large pan of boiling salted water, following pack instructions, until just al dente. Reheat the fennel sauce over a medium heat and transfer the pasta directly from its water to the sauce using tongs. Add a good ladleful of the pasta cooking water to loosen the mix, then spoon in the white crabmeat. Stir everything together well to agitate the mixture and emulsify the sauce. Add the crab and crème fraîche mixture, and stir for a few minutes until the sauce is thick and glossy. Stir in the chopped herbs and taste for seasoning – the sauce should be thick, silky and not too runny, so continue to cook until it’s the right thickness, if needed. Season with a little lemon juice, then divide between warmed bowls."

After 1 hr the chicken should be tender – try pulling a leg away from the breast with some tongs. If there’s much resistance, keep cooking, checking every 10 mins or so. Carefully remove the chicken from the cooking liquid and leave to cool on a plate for about 10 mins.",

Continue until all of the stock has been used up and you have a smooth sauce.",

All the veg can be cooked the day before and kept in the fridge.",
   "For the pastry, boil the kettle and use some coconut oil to grease a deep 20cm springform cake tin. Pour the flour into a bowl and add 1 tsp salt. Mix the coconut oil with 200ml boiling water, stir until melted (put it in the microwave if need be), then pour into the flour and mix with a wooden spoon to form a dough. Working as quickly as you can (it’s best to roll the pastry when it’s warm), cut off a ¼ of the dough and set aside under a tea towel. Roll out the rest to 0.5cm thick, then use it to line the cake tin, pressing the dough into the corners and leaving any excess pastry overhanging the sides. Don’t worry if the pastry breaks – it’s very forgiving, so you can patch it up as you go. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.",
   "Now build the pie. Cover the base with chard leaves, then scatter over the semolina (which will absorb the beet juices), press in the beetroot, and season. Add another layer of chard, followed by the sweet potato, and season. Add a final layer of chard leaves, then top with the celeriac and season again.",
   "Roll out the pastry you set aside to a thickness of 0.5cm to use as the lid. Put the lid on top of the pie and, using a fork, press together the overhanging pastry to create a crimped edge. Make a steam hole, then brush the top with a little almond milk mixed with a spoonful of oil (this will help to colour the pastry). Bake in the centre of the oven for 45 mins until the pastry is a deep golden brown. Leave to cool for 15 mins, then remove from the tin and serve in the middle of the table. Will keep for up to three days in the fridge (the pie is also delicious cold)."

   "Tip the pastry onto a lightly floured surface, gather into a smooth ball, then roll out as thinly as you can.",
   "Line a 23 x 2.5cm loose-bottomed, fluted flan tin, easing the pastry into the base.",
   "Trim the pastry edges with scissors (save any trimmings) so it sits slightly above the tin (if it shrinks, it shouldn’t now go below the level of the tin). Press the pastry into the flutes, lightly prick the base with a fork, then chill for 10 mins.",
   "Put a baking sheet in the oven and heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Line pastry case with foil, shiny side down, fill with dry beans and bake on the hot sheet for 15 mins.",
   "Remove foil and beans and bake for 4-5 mins more until the pastry is pale golden. If you notice any small holes or cracks, patch up with pastry trimmings. You can make up to this point a day ahead.",
   "While the pastry cooks, prepare the filling. Heat a small frying pan, tip in 200g lardons and fry for a couple of mins. Drain off any liquid that comes out, then continue cooking until the lardons just start to colour, but aren’t crisp. Remove and drain on paper towels.",
   "Cut three quarters of the 50g gruyère into small dice and finely grate the rest. Scatter the diced gruyère and fried lardons over the bottom of the pastry case.",
   "Using a spoon, beat 200ml crème fraîche to slacken it then slowly beat in 200ml double cream. Mix in 3 well beaten eggs. Season (you shouldn’t need much salt) and add a pinch of ground nutmeg. Pour three quarters of the filling into the pastry case.",
   "Half-pull the oven shelf out and put the flan tin on the baking sheet. Quickly pour the rest of the filling into the pastry case – you get it right to the top this way. Scatter the grated cheese over the top, then carefully push the shelf back into the oven.",
   "Lower the oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Bake for about 25 mins, or until golden and softly set (the centre should not feel too firm).",

   "Use a layer of the green part of the leek to wrap around and make a herb bundle with the thyme, bay, parsley stalks, orange peel and chilli. Tie everything together with kitchen string and set aside.",
   "Heat the oil in a very large casserole dish or stock pot and throw in the onion, sliced leek and fennel and cook for about 10 mins until softened. Stir through the garlic and cook for 2 mins more, then add the herb bundle, tomato purée, star anise, Pernod if using, chopped tomatoes and saffron. Simmer and stir for a minute or two then pour over the fish stock. Season with salt and pepper, bring to a simmer, then add the piece of potato. Bubble everything gently for 30 mins until you have a thin tomatoey soup. When that piece of potato is on the brink of collapse, fish it out and set aside to make the rouille.",
   "While the broth is simmering make the rouille by crushing the garlic, chilli and saffron with a pinch of salt in a mortar with a pestle. Mash in the cooked potato to make a sticky paste then whisk in the egg yolk and, very gradually, the olive oil until you make a mayonnaise-like sauce. Stir in the lemon juice and set aside.",
   "Once the chunky tomato broth has cooked you have two options: for a rustic bouillabaisse, simply poach your fish in it along with the mussels, if you're using (just until they open) and serve. For a refined version, remove the herb bundle and star anise. Using a handheld or table-top blender, blitz the soup until smooth. Pass the soup through a sieve into a large, clean pan and bring to a gentle simmer. Starting with the densest fish, add the chunks to the broth and cook for 1 min before adding the next type. With the fish we used, the order was: monkfish, John Dory, grey mullet, snapper. When all the fish is in, scatter over the mussels, if using, and simmer everything for about 5 mins until just cooked and the mussels have opened.",
   "Use a slotted spoon to carefully scoop the fish and mussels out onto a warmed serving platter, moisten with just a little broth and scatter over the chopped parsley. Bring everything to the table. Some people eat it as two courses, serving the broth with croutons and rouille first, then the fish spooned into the same bowl. Others simply serve it as a fish stew. Whichever way you choose the rouille is there to be stirred into the broth to thicken and give it a kick."

   "Tip the ‘00’ flour into a large food processor with a pinch of salt and the beaten eggs and yolks. Pulse in short bursts, being careful not to overheat the motor, and scrape the sides with a spatula between pulses to incorporate any dry flour. Stop pulsing when the mixture has come together in even crumbs. Tip onto a work surface and knead for 5-10 mins until you have a smooth, firm dough. If it’s very dry, you may need to add a splash of water to bring it together. Shape into a ball, wrap and chill for at least 1 hr and up to two days.",
   "Keeping the rest of the dough well covered, roll a quarter into a rectangle that will fit through the widest setting on your pasta machine. Pass the dough through the machine, reducing the width down to level three. This means it won’t be super thin, but will have a nice bite to it when cooked.",
   "Unfold the dough onto a work surface dusted with semolina. Cut it into smaller 25cm sheets, then cut each of the sheets lengthways into 2.5cm-thick pappardelle strips. Toss the strips in semolina. Repeat the rolling and cutting with the remaining dough, a quarter at a time. Once all cut, leave to dry for a few mins on a parchment-lined tray generously dusted with semolina – this will make it easier to handle. Cook the pasta in a large pan of salted water for 3 mins, then drain to serve."

   "Heat the oil in a large flameproof casserole dish. Toss the lamb in the flour with some seasoning, then brown it in the dish. Do this in batches so you don’t overcrowd the dish (which will cause the meat to steam instead of fry). Take your time to build up a deep brown colour, which will add lots of meaty flavour to the stew. Set the meat aside on a plate as you go.",
   "Add the remaining oil to the dish along with the onion and garlic. Cook for 5 mins until softened, then stir in the spices, tomatoes, lemon zest and juice, honey and molasses. Fill the tomato can halfway with water, swill around and add this too. Season well, bring to a simmer and cover with a lid. Reduce the heat and cook for 2 hrs 30 mins-3 hrs or until the meat is tender. Leave to cool.",
   "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Transfer the meat to a pie dish that’s about 25cm wide, or leave it in the casserole if it’s wide enough to fit the topping. Unwrap the filo and brush a sheet with butter, scrunch up and place on top of the pie. Continue with the remaining sheets until the tagine is covered. Drizzle any remaining butter over the top and scatter over the almonds, then bake for 45 mins or until the pastry is crisp and golden. Scatter over the pomegranate seeds just before serving."

   "To prepare the spices that will be simmered with the pork, pound the cinnamon, ginger, lime leaves and peppercorns using a pestle and mortar to a rough paste. Add the garlic. Roughly break up the star anise – it’s much too strong if you pound it – and add that too. Tip the spice mixture into a flameproof roasting tin that the pork will fit into. Lay the pork on top, skin-side down. Add enough boiling water to come just up to the level of the meat. Bring to a simmer on the hob and cook for 20 mins.",

Spread the spice rub over the pork, then drizzle on a little oil and rub all over the pork. Sprinkle over some sea salt, put in the oven and cook for 20 mins, then turn the heat down to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and cook for a further 45 mins. Finish under the grill for 10 mins to crisp up the skin.",
   "Make the sauce while the pork is cooking. Heat the oil in a frying pan and cook the shallots over a medium heat until golden. Add the chilli, garlic, and ginger and cook for 2 mins, then add the sugar. Cook until the sugar caramelises – be careful not to burn it – then quickly add 300ml water (it will sizzle and spit a bit). Stir in the lime leaves, fish sauce, lime juice and peanut butter. Bring to a simmer, stirring to break down the peanut butter. Taste. I usually add a little tamarind paste, but you might prefer to add more lime juice or fish sauce. Serve the pork belly with the sauce, rice and greens."

Chill until serving. Mix 3 tbsp white wine vinegar with 2 tsp sugar, 1 garlic clove, grated, and 1 medium red chilli, finely chopped.

  ],
  "Method": [
   "If you have time, season the pork skin the day before with salt, then put in the fridge, uncovered. If you want to get ahead, tip the potatoes into a large pan of cold, salted water, bring to the boil and simmer gently for about 8-10 mins until the potatoes are cooked all the way through but not falling apart. Gently drain the potatoes in a colander, but don’t shake them or ruffle them up – just leave them to drain and cool. Put them in the fridge, uncovered, until ready to roast.",
   "To make the stuffing, heat the butter in a saucepan and cook the onion for 10 mins until soft and golden. Tip the onions into a bowl with the all the other ingredients and season with lots of black pepper. Scrunch everything together with your hands and chill until needed.",
   "To stuff the pork, get a long-bladed knife like a carving knife and create a large pocket between the eye of the meat and the bones. Turn the blade of the knife to open up the cavity. You might need to go in at both ends. Use your fingers to push in as much of the stuffing as you possibly can, pushing it right down into the cavity.",
   "Heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 9. If you haven’t already parboiled the potatoes, do so now (see step 1). Sit the pork in a shallow roasting tin (season if you haven’t done it the day before), drizzle the skin liberally with sunflower oil and put it in the oven for 20 mins. Lower the heat to 200C/180C/gas 6 and continue to roast the pork for 1 hr, basting the skin occasionally with the fat from the tin. Remove the tin from the oven and you should have a nice layer of fat in the bottom. Baste the pork again, then carefully pour the fat into another roasting tin and add the potatoes. Use a spatula to turn them in the fat so they are completely coated and put back in the oven for 40 mins, by which time the pork skin should have crackled and the potatoes begun to turn golden. Transfer the pork to a board, uncovered, and leave to rest for 20 mins.",
   "While the pork is resting, turn the potatoes, then score a line around each apple and sit them in the sticky pork tin. Dot them with half the butter and roast for 20 mins until they are soft. By then, the potatoes should be golden too.",
   "Heat the remaining butter in a pan until sizzling and fry the sage leaves, turning, until crisp, then transfer to a piece of kitchen paper to drain. To serve, arrange the potatoes and apples around the pork and scatter with the crispy sage leaves. Carve the pork into chops."

   "Soak the dried porcini in 600ml kettle-hot water and set aside to cool, then drain, squeezing out the mushrooms and reserving the liquid. Heat half the butter in a pan and fry the onions for 7-8 mins until golden, then add the garlic and thyme and cook for a few minutes more. Add the remaining butter to the pan, then the soaked mushrooms and chestnut mushrooms. Turn up the heat and sizzle everything for 5 mins until the mushrooms are cooked and golden. Pour in the port and simmer to a sticky glaze, then the mushroom soaking liquid, and crumble in the stock cube before boiling everything rapidly for about 5 mins. Drain the mushroom mix using a sieve and leave to cool. Reserve and chill the liquid to use later for gravy.",
   "When the mushrooms are cool, butterfly the turkey breast by cutting into one side of it so you can open it like a book. Cover the meat and use a meat mallet or rolling pin to bash it out to a rectangle about 3cm thick and a little smaller than A4 paper. Trim the edges and top to neaten it up, reserving the trimmings. Tip the turkey trimmings, mushrooms, parsley, lemon zest and parmesan into a food processor and season generously. Pulse to make a rough stuffing. Form the stuffing into a long sausage positioned along the long edge of the turkey breast. Roll the turkey to encase the stuffing and set aside.",
   "On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry to a rectangle about 10cm wider and longer than the turkey was when you beat it out. Trim the edges, reserving the trimmings. Lightly brush the pastry all over with the egg yolk. Lay the turkey in the middle of the pastry. Fold the shorter edges over the turkey, then roll up the whole thing to encase. If you like, re-roll the trimmings, cut into Christmas shapes and use to decorate. Brush all over with egg yolk, place on a tray, seam-side down. Chill for at least 30 mins or up to two days. ",
   "To bake, heat the oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 6 with a tray inside. Brush the wellington with more egg yolk and season with sea salt flakes. Transfer to the hot tray and bake for 1 hr 15 mins until the pastry is golden and crisp. While the wellington is cooking, simmer the reserved mushroom liquid until reduced to a sticky gravy. Leave the wellington to rest, then serve in thick slices with the gravy."

   "Heat oven to 150C/130C fan/gas 2. For the meat sauce, heat the butter in a large casserole dish. Scatter in the pancetta and sizzle gently for 5 mins until just starting to brown, then add the onion and carrot and soften in the pancetta fat for a few mins. Stir in the meat. At first it will look as if it’s just steaming, but persevere and the juices will evaporate and the meat will sizzle and start to brown – this will take around 15 mins. When the beef is brown, add the garlic, bay leaf, oregano and some pepper and cook for 5 mins, then add the ketchup and cook to a paste. Season, pour over the wine and the passata, give everything a stir, bring to a simmer, then cover and place in the oven for 2 hrs, stirring occasionally until the meat is really tender. The sauce can be prepared up to three days ahead or frozen for three months.",
   "For the white sauce, pour the milk into a saucepan with the dried mushrooms, bring to the boil, then turn off the heat and leave the mushrooms to soak for 20 mins. Drain the mushrooms over a bowl, pressing down to release all the milk. Reserve the milk, roughly chop the mushrooms and set aside. Heat two-thirds of the butter in a large, shallow pan until it starts to turn a nutty brown. Add the mushrooms and a bay leaf, and sizzle for a few mins. Scatter the flour over the mushrooms and cook until it’s a sticky paste. Gradually add the milk, stirring between each addition, until you have a thick sauce. Add the parmesan rinds if you have them, then simmer for 10 mins, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat, lift out the bay leaf and any rinds, then stir in the mascarpone and a third of the parmesan. Season with salt, pepper and grate in some nutmeg.",
   "Rub oil onto the base and sides of a large ceramic baking dish. Put a layer of lasagne sheets on the base, then a layer of the meat sauce, followed by a drizzle of mushroom sauce, and then tear and scatter over the mozzarella. Repeat until you have used all the pasta and meat sauce and top with a final layer of pasta. Finish with a thick layer of mushroom sauce and sprinkle with a layer of parmesan, reserving a handful. Scatter the remaining parmesan over a non-stick baking sheet or a baking sheet lined with baking parchment.",
   "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Bake the lasagne in the oven for 40-45 mins or until bubbling and golden brown. For the last 15 mins, put the parmesan tray in the oven on a higher shelf and cook until brown and crisp. Remove both from the oven and leave for 10 mins. Cut the lasagne into squares and let it sit for another 10 mins before serving to keep the layers defined and help it cool. Break the crispy parmesan into shards and serve in a side dish to scatter over the lasagne."

   "To make the pastry, put the flour in a big bowl and mix in a good pinch of salt and the cheese. Using a coarse cheese grater, grate in the butter – try to hold it as little as possible so it doesn’t warm up too much – and stir it in with a knife as you go. When all the butter is in, give it a final stir to make sure all the strands of butter are coated with flour, then quickly stir in 125ml of very cold water. Splash in a little more if it looks dry, then lightly bring the pastry together with your hands. Wrap in cling film and chill for at least 30 mins.",
   "Meanwhile, bring a big pan of water to the boil, then tip in the potatoes. Boil until just tender, then drain well, slice and allow to cool.",
   "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 with a baking tray inside. On a large sheet of baking parchment dusted with a little flour, roll out the pastry into a rough circle about 30cm wide, until the thickness of 2 x £1 coins. Brush the mustard over the pastry. Arrange the potatoes, asparagus and most of the gruyère in layers in the centre of the base, leaving a border of pastry that’s roughly 5cm all the way around. Season and fold up the pastry edges to enclose the vegetables and cheese, pinching the edges to seal. Whisk together the soured cream and the egg with a little seasoning, then pour into the centre of the tart. Sprinkle over the remaining cheese and slide the tart onto the preheated baking tray. Bake for 30 mins until the pastry is golden and crisp. Eat just warm or at room temperature."

Slowly pour in 500ml of the reserved ham stock to make a silky sauce, then add the cream. Season with a grating of nutmeg and a grinding pepper, then taste to see if it needs more salt. Bring to a simmer and stir gently for 5 mins, then take off the heat and stir through all the cauliflower and most of the cheese. Will keep chilled for up to 24 hours.",

To glaze, brush the ham fat with the mustard, then scatter over the sugar (don’t worry if some goes on the cauliflower). Scatter over the remaining cheese (avoid getting any on the ham) and grill for 10-15 mins until the ham is glossy and browned and the cauliflower cheese is bubbling and golden. Leave to rest for 5 mins before serving."

Roast the pumpkin for 30 mins until almost tender but not too soft. Meanwhile add the shallots to the pan, rolling around now and then, until golden. Scoop the shallots out and set aside.",
   "Add the remaining oil to the pan and brown the venison – you’ll need to do this in batches so that you don’t overcrowd the pan. Take your time, ensuring the meat has a nice dark-brown crust before you remove it from the pan – this will give the tagine a good rich flavour.",
   "While the meat browns, heat a frying pan and tip in the cumin, coriander seeds, peppercorns, cinnamon stick and cloves. Warm the spices through, stirring them around from time to time, until they turn a shade darker and smell aromatic. Put the cinnamon stick to one side with the venison, and tip the remaining spices into the small bowl of a food processor or a mortar. Whizz or pound with a pestle to a powder. Add the coriander stalks, ginger, garlic, chilli and 1 tsp salt, and blend to a paste (you may have to add a little water if using a food processor).",
   "When all the venison pieces have been browned, return the meat to the pan with the cinnamon stick. Stir in the spice paste and sizzle for 1-2 mins, splashing in a little water if the paste starts to stick to the bottom of the pan. Add the saffron and pour in the stock. Bring to a simmer, cover with a lid and leave to bubble over a gentle heat for 1 hr 30 mins, stirring occasionally.",
   "Add the browned shallots, prunes and pomegranate molasses to the tagine, increase the heat a little and bubble without a lid for 30 mins more, until the liquid has reduced and the tagine is rich and tasty. Season and stir in the pumpkin 10 mins before the tagine is finished cooking. Stir through the coriander leaves and serve with your favourite grain – bulghar wheat, quinoa or brown rice goes well – and a dollop of yogurt. Even better if cooled and served the next day. This tagine will last for up to 3 days in the fridge or can be frozen for 2 months."

   "Mix the flour, mustard powder and some seasoning in a large bowl, then toss in the steak and kidneys until they are coated. Remove the vegetables from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add the remaining dripping to the pan and fry the meat until browned.",
   "Stir the stout into the remaining flour left in the bowl, then pour into the pan of meat with the stock, and stir over the heat until thickened to a gravy. Return the vegetables to the pan, cover tightly and simmer for 1 hr 15 mins-1 hr 30 mins, stirring frequently, so that the flour in the sauce doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan. If necessary, add a drop or two of water to loosen the consistency, but not too much as you want a thick gravy. The meat won’t be completely tender, but it will cook further in the pudding. Set aside to cool or chill overnight.",
   "To make the suet pastry, put the flour, baking powder and suet in a bowl with 1/2 tsp salt. Pour in 150ml cold water and stir with a round-bladed knife to bring the mixture together as a dough. Tip onto a lightly floured surface, knead briefly until smooth, then cut off 1/4 and set aside.",
   "Very generously grease a 1.2-litre pudding basin. Roll out the biggest piece of dough to a circle large enough to line the inside of the basin right up to the rim. Press the pastry into the basin so that it is an even thickness, then spoon in the steak \u0026 kidney mixture. Roll out the remaining pastry to make a round to fit as a lid on top of the basin. Brush round the edge with water, then place on top of the filling, wetted-side down, and seal all the way round with the sides to enclose.",
   "Cover the basin with a double layer of greased baking parchment and foil, pleating them first to allow for expansion (alternatively, use muslin). Then tie with string, adding a string handle for easy lifting in and out of the pan.",

If you need to, top with more boiling water, but if the seal is tight, this shouldn’t be required.",

Cook the wings on the barbecue or under the grill for 10 mins each side, until the chicken is cooked through and the skin is golden brown and crisp.",

In the same pan, brown the beef well in batches for 5-8 mins, adding a drizzle more oil if you need to, then set aside.",

Tip the beef and bacon, along with any juices, back into the pan and give it all a good stir. Pour in the ale and stock, and nestle in the thyme stalks and bay. Season generously and bring to a simmer. Cover with a lid and cook in the oven for about 2 hrs or until the meat is really tender. Leave everything to cool slightly, then strain off about half the braising liquid into another container. Leave to cool completely. Can be made up to two days ahead and kept chilled in the fridge – the pie will be better if the filling is fridge-cold when added. Can also be frozen for up to three months.",
   "To make the pastry, mix the flour, mustard powder, lard and butter with a generous pinch of sea salt until completely combined, then gradually add up to 250ml ice-cold water to make a soft dough.

Roll out the remaining pastry to a thick round that will easily line the pie dish with an overhang, then line the tin. Tip in the beef mixture. You want the filling to be slightly higher than the rim of the dish. Brush the edges with egg yolk. Roll out the remaining pastry to a thick round, big enough to cover the pie, then lift onto the pie dish. Trim the edges, crimp together, then re-roll the trimmings and cut into decorative shapes, such as leaves. Brush the top with more yolk.

Tip into a large bowl. Put the spinach in the pan and allow it to wilt. Leave to cool and, when cold, squeeze out as much liquid from it as you possibly can.",
   "Tip the chestnut purée into the bowl with the leeks and add the 3 eggs, the nutmeg, chestnuts, spinach, breadcrumbs, cheese and seasoning, and stir until well mixed. Chill for at least 1 hr until the mixture firms up.",
   "Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the pastry to a rectangle large enough to completely enclose the filling. Carefully lift onto a large, long baking tray that has been lined with baking parchment, then brush round all the edges of the pastry with the remaining egg. Spoon the filling down the centre of the length of the pastry, leaving the ends clear. Tuck the ends over the filling, then firmly lift up the sides to wrap them round, trimming away any excess pastry as you go. Brush with more egg to glaze, then make a few holes in the top so steam can escape as it cooks. Bake for 40 mins until golden and the filling is firm. Remove from the oven, brush with more glaze and bake for 10 mins more.",
   "To make the sauce, heat the stock in a medium pan, add the leeks, boil for 5 mins, then take off the heat and scoop out 2 tbsp of the leeks. Blitz the rest in the pan with the cornflour using a hand blender, then cook, stirring, until thickened. Pour in the cream and reserved leeks and warm through. Can be made 2 days ahead and chilled. Serve the pastry in thick slices with the sauce."

Lay one sheet of filo on a chopping board and brush all over with the garlic butter, then sprinkle with some chives and cracked black pepper. Place another sheet of pastry on top at a slight angle and repeat. Continue in this way until you have used up all the pastry and almost all the garlic butter. You should have created a jagged-edged pastry circle. Lay this on top of the pie dish, then use a sharp knife to trim the edges, but still leave an overhang. Brush with a final layer of butter, sprinkle with flaky sea salt and bake for 40 mins or until the pastry is golden and crisp. Serve with the Charred Baby Gem, watercress \u0026 bacon salad (see recipe, Goes well with)."

   "Score the pork belly skin with a sharp knife in a cross pattern. Score down to just before where the skin meets the fat, rather than the fat itself. Bring a large saucepan of water to a simmer and add the bicarbonate of soda. Lower the pork into the water, poach gently for 5 mins, then remove it from the water and leave to cool to room temperature.",
   "Meanwhile, toast the fennel seeds and chilli flakes in a dry frying pan over a high heat for 1-2 mins, then tip into a bowl and leave to cool. Grind the spices in a spice grinder or with a pestle and mortar, then mix with 1 tbsp fine sea salt.",
   "Once the pork has cooled, turn it skin-side down and pierce the underside of the meat all over with a knife. Rub the meat with the spiced salt rub, cover and put it in the fridge for at least 8 hrs or overnight. Can be prepared 24 hours ahead.",
   "The next day, make your stuffing. Heat the olive oil in a non-stick frying pan and add the onion and fennel. Season and cook gently over a low heat for 10 mins. Add the coriander seeds and garlic, and cook for another 2 mins, then add the mince. Cook for 8-10 mins until the mince is browned. Set aside and leave to cool.",
   "Transfer the mince and onion mix to a bowl and add the sourdough, pine nuts, orange zest, apricots, herbs, lemon juice and nutmeg. Season well, then mix together thoroughly with your hands. Add the egg and mix again.",
   "Lie the pork belly on a board, skin-side down. Form the stuffing into a sausage shape running all the way down the middle of the belly. Wrap the sides of the belly around the stuffing and tie with butcher’s string. Place seam-side down in a roasting tin, uncovered, and chill for at least 2 hrs, preferably overnight. You want the skin to dry out completely so that it crisps up when you roast it.",
   "To cook the pork, remove it from the fridge and leave it for at least 1 hr to come to room temperature before you cook it. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/ gas 4 and cook the pork for about 2 hrs, turning the tin every 30 mins or so. After 2 hrs, turn the heat up to 220C/ 200C fan/gas 7 and cook for another 20 mins. When the pork is done, a thermometer pushed into its centre should read 77C. If the skin looks in danger of burning, cover it with foil – but only do this once it has crackled.",
   "Once the pork has cooked, remove from the oven and leave to rest for 30 mins. When you’re ready to carve, put the pork on a big chopping board. Using a sharp knife, slice the meat into rounds."
